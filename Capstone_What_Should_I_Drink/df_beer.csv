90 Minute IPA,/beer/profile/64/2093/,4.27,"15,783",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,9,90,"    Esquire Magazine calls our 90 Minute IPA ""perhaps the best IPA in America."" An imperial IPA best savored from a snifter 90 Minute has a great malt backbone that stands up to the extreme hopping rate.  90 Minute IPA was the first beer we continuously hopped allowing for a pungent -- but not crushing -- hop flavor.

Punkin Ale,/beer/profile/64/6260/,3.93,"6,645",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,7,28,    A full-bodied brown ale with smooth hints of pumpkin and brown sugar. We brew our Punkin Ale with pumpkin meat brown sugar and spices. As the season cools this is the perfect beer to warm up with.  Punkin Ale is named after the seriously off-centered southern Delaware extravaganza Punkin Chunkin (check out some of these Discovery Channel videos of Punkin Chunkin you gotta see it to believe it!). In fact Punkin Ale made its debut as it claimed first prize in the 1994 Punkin Chunkin Recipe Contest. Yes that was a full 6 months before we even opened our doors for business!   
Burton Baton,/beer/profile/64/18862/,4.23,"6,638",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,10,70,"    This oak-aged gentle giant has been gaining popularity over the past few years and is now available year-round.  For Burton Baton we brew two ""threads"" or batches of beer: an English-style old ale and an imperial IPA.  After fementating the beers separately in our stainless tanks they're transferred and blended together in one of our large oak tanks. Burton Baton sits on the wood for about a month.  When enjoying the Burton Baton you'll find an awesome blend of the citrus notes from Northwestern hops melding with woody vanilla notes from the oak. The wood also tends to mellow the 10% ABV of Burton so tread cautiously!  "

A cross between a Scotch Ale an India Pale Ale and an American Brown Indian Brown Ale is well-hopped and malty at the same time (It's magical!).  The beer has characteristics of each style that inspired it: the color of an American Brown the caramel notes of a Scotch Ale and the hopping regiment of an India Pale Ale. We dry-hop the Indian Brown Ale in a similar fashion to our 60 Minute IPA and 90 Minute IPA. This beer is brewed with Aromatic barley and organic brown sugar.

Much like its namesake this imperial IPA is regal intense and mighty. With hops and malts as his servants he rules both with a heavy hand. The Maharaja flaunts his authority over a deranged amount of hops: tangy vibrant and pungent along with an insane amount of malted barley – fashioning a dark amber hue and exquisite malt essence. Welcome to his kingdom!  The Maharaja is the second installment in our Dictator Series.

"Smuttynose IPA ""Finest Kind""",/beer/profile/141/16403/,4.1,"5,337",Smuttynose Brewing Company,6.9,75,    You could say then that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze as we bottle it unfiltered. At 's this is definitely not a training-wheels IPA but is meant for hop lovers looking to satisfy their craving in a way that's not easy to find. We think they’ll be quite pleased.

Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale,/beer/profile/423/50570/,4.17,"5,285",Boulevard Brewing Co.,8.5,38,    Most breweries have at least one piece of equipment that’s just a bit persnickity. Here at Boulevard we have fermenter number seven the black sheep of our cellar family. Ironically when our brewers were experimenting with variations on a traditional Belgian-style farmhouse ale the perfect combination of elements came together in that very vessel. You could call it fate but they called it Tank 7 and so it is. Beginning with a big surge of fruity aromatics and grapefruit-hoppy notes the flavor of this complex straw-colored ale tapers off to a peppery dry finish.  
Red's Rye IPA,/beer/profile/1199/16074/,4.18,"5,258",Founders Brewing Company,6.6,70,    Brewed with four varieties of Belgian caramel malts and 100% Amarillo hops.

ApriHop,/beer/profile/64/3951/,3.84,"4,995",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,7,50,    Aprihop is an American IPA brewed with Pilsner and Crystal malts. It's massively hopped -- in the continuous fashion of course! -- and the flavor is complemented by the addition of apricots.  After fermentation the beer is dry hopped with irresponsible amounts of Amarillo hops. The beer has a hoppy aroma with the apricots playing a supporting role.  The flavor is rich with late hop flavors and its bitterness is tempered by just the right amount of malt sweetness and fruity undertones from the apricots.

World Wide Stout,/beer/profile/64/2392/,4.22,"4,940",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,18,70,    Brewed with a ridiculous amount of barley World Wide Stout is dark rich roasty and complex. This Ageable Ale clocks in at 15-20% ABV and has a depth more in line with a fine port than with a can of cheap mass-marketed beer.  
Midas Touch,/beer/profile/64/1587/,3.73,"4,897",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,9,12,    This sweet yet dry beer is made with ingredients found in 2700-year-old drinking vessels from the tomb of King Midas. Somewhere between wine and mead Midas will please the chardonnay and beer drinker alike.

Raison D'Être,/beer/profile/64/1180/,3.66,"4,306",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,8,25,"    A deep mahogany Belgian-style brown ale brewed with beet sugar raisins and Belgian-style yeast.  We began brewing this one at our pub in 1996 (we began packaging and selling it sometime in 1998) as the answer to the question ""What beer should I enjoy with a wood-grilled steak?"" Raison D'Etre fits the bill. It's as tasty and complex as a fine red wine.  In the Quick Sip Clip video Sam talks about Raison D'Etre inside the new cellars for our 600-bbl fermentation tanks. The cellars were designed specifically to allow sterile yeast management. The system also allows us to automatically dose the yeast into the fermentation tanks. At Dogfish we use multiple strains of yeast for our different beers so we are acutely aware of all that can go wrong when you don't love and protect the yeast.  "

Harpoon IPA,/beer/profile/98/311/,3.62,"4,194",Harpoon Brewery & Beer Hall,5.9,42,    We started brewing this beer as a summer seasonal in 1993. There were some great IPAs out in the Pacific Northwest but no local IPAs on the east coast. We wanted to have a local IPA so we brewed one. People absolutely loved it and so did we. So we made it a year-round beer and it’s now our bestselling beer and our flagship.  Since its introduction Harpoon IPA has remained unique in its ability to balance hop bitterness with a strong malt backbone. Dry-hopped with Cascade hops it has a floral hop aroma and a finish that is bitter (it is an IPA after all!) without being harsh or astringent. Combined with a malty sweetness and the fruity esters of our proprietary yeast those hops create a beer that is wonderfully hoppy but clean and refreshing enough to enjoy a few of - and we hope you do.
