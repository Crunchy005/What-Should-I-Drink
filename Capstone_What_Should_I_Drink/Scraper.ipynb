It\\'s as tasty and complex as a fine red wine.  In the Quick Sip Clip video Sam talks about Raison D\\'Etre inside the new cellars for our 600-bbl fermentation tanks. The cellars were designed specifically to allow sterile yeast management. The system also allows us to automatically dose the yeast into the fermentation tanks. At Dogfish we use multiple strains of yeast for our different beers so we are acutely aware of all that can go wrong when you don\\'t love and protect the yeast.  ',\n",

       " '    We started brewing this beer as a summer seasonal in 1993. There were some great IPAs out in the Pacific Northwest but no local IPAs on the east coast. We wanted to have a local IPA so we brewed one. People absolutely loved it and so did we. So we made it a year-round beer and it’s now our bestselling beer and our flagship.  Since its introduction Harpoon IPA has remained unique in its ability to balance hop bitterness with a strong malt backbone. Dry-hopped with Cascade hops it has a floral hop aroma and a finish that is bitter (it is an IPA after all!) without being harsh or astringent. Combined with a malty sweetness and the fruity esters of our proprietary yeast those hops create a beer that is wonderfully hoppy but clean and refreshing enough to enjoy a few of - and we hope you do.

Full, lasting, head and thick lacing would boost the score higher, but personally I place 80% of my opinion on taste, and this tastes great  Tastes of chocolate and coffee, and the finish is moist, alcohol with a hint of bitterness, but not overbearing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Aftertaste is gone quickly and leaves no lingering bitterness which is really nice. There is way less bitterness than the 60 IBU would indicate. The ABV is 8.30% which is pretty high. The beer doesn't taste that alcoholic, but you definitely feel that alcohol after a glass. (Well, at least I do). Overall a great beer, with my only wish being a lesser price than the $12 I had to pay for a 4-pack.  Founders makes a great, beer, though, and they deserve every penny.\\xa0\",\n",

One of the most opaque stouts I have seen, with a rich burgundy red head to boot, which had dissipated within minutes, leaving behind a ebony jewel. A truly bold example, and a textbook stout aesthectic.  Smell Chocolate! Creamy, succulent, mouth-watering cocoa hit me immediately, followed by coffee, some nutmeg, oats, concluding with a roasted hoppiness. Truth be told, it is the most dynamic smelling stout I have tried! Aeration brought the coffee front and center, revieling what seemed that of dark fruits (blackberries,  black cherries, etc.)  Taste My goodness, we have a winner! This stout is remarkable! A frighteningly dynamic pallet hits you with haste; the most outstanding flavors being chocolate and roasted coffee, with almost the consistency of cappuccino. Slight aeration within the mouth dug up overtones of blackberries, honey, and nutmeg, which was a wonderful surprise. With a pallete as varied as this, the breakfast stout could please just about anyone. Given its ABV rating, the taste of alcohol was far  down on my list.  Feel Incredible, and thick! An amalgamtion of creams and soups - almost as rich as steamed machiato. No alcohol burn at all, going down easily. The warmth of this stout is strong, sitting heavily in the stomach. It was  a comforting experience making it perfect for the bitterness of January.  Overall Founders has yet to deter my interest, although this stout sticks out with such tenacity. I have yet to try a stout as exciting and open ended as this. Well done, Michigan!\\xa01,',\n",
       " 'An exceptional stout, the flavor is balanced, and the chocolate and coffee jump right out, with just the right amount mealyness in the background. The first half of the beer is a solid 5 in every category. The only reason I dropped the overall to a 4.25 is because the second half starts to become a bit overbearing in terms of sweetness and heavyness. Not a beer I could drink back to back but still an exceptional beer\\xa0',\n",

Full, lasting, head and thick lacing would boost the score higher, but personally I place 80% of my opinion on taste, and this tastes great  Tastes of chocolate and coffee, and the finish is moist, alcohol with a hint of bitterness, but not overbearing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Aftertaste is gone quickly and leaves no lingering bitterness which is really nice. There is way less bitterness than the 60 IBU would indicate. The ABV is 8.30% which is pretty high. The beer doesn't taste that alcoholic, but you definitely feel that alcohol after a glass. (Well, at least I do). Overall a great beer, with my only wish being a lesser price than the $12 I had to pay for a 4-pack.  Founders makes a great, beer, though, and they deserve every penny.\\xa0\",\n",

       " 'For me it all started on a snowy day in 2015, I was in a small college town of Monmouth Oregon. Beer was just recently introduced to me by a family friend. Not only did he tell me it would change my life, but it would affect how I did things from here on out. It did change my life, and it started with the 90 minute IPA by Dogfish Head. I was working at a winery at the time, but it was so snowy outside (oregon terms) because of this work was cancelled. I was still able to drive around with four-wheel drive, so I listen to my peers and seeked out a location where I could get my hands on this elusive beer. I purchased a four pack and brought it back to Monmouth. The ensuing hours later provided plenty of entertainment and joy. At this moment when I first put my lips to a 90-minute bottle, I knew what love was. From that moment forward I will never forget the night I fell in love with the pure lifestyle of Craft Brew in general.\\xa0',\n",

My go to beers are the ones you can't see through, but this came highly recommended by someone whose beer knowledge and opinions I trust implicitly.   Interestingly, rather than having a sharp, aggressive hoppiness, the DFH 90-Minute IPA is very balanced. Strong beery smell and taste, but the flavor had an amazing citrus zestiness that stays on your tongue. Nice head, deep gold color, good amount of carbonation, and at 9% ABV, I feel a bit woozy.
