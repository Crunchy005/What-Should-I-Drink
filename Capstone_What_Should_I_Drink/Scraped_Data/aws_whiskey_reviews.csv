Ries,b,n: fuller rich nose; full vanilla caramels vanilla wafers dried red fruit and milk chocolate bar. t: quite malty with a nice density to this. Doesn't stray too far from young sherry cask influence and vanilla oak char. Has an all-spice and dried figs & strawberry middle that gets even dryer in the brown sugar and vanilla caramel finish. End is a dark chocolate covered raisins. This is a nice everyday sipper; barely semi-sweet but a great value.

Sku,bplus,The nose on this is pure port with some brown sugar.  The palate is similarly big on wine with fruity port or sherry.  Digging deep there is a caramel bourbon note underneath but I can't say I would pick it out if I didn't know this was actually a bourbon.  The port notes increase as it trails off into the finish where it's joined by some oak. It's not often that I taste something that's totally unique.  Tasting blind there is no way I would guess this was bourbon. If I had to compare it to anything I would say it tastes most similar to the Navazos Palazzi sherried brandy than anything else I've tasted. Usually when I taste finished bourbons I'm left with the feeling that the finishing was just a method to add some sweetness to an inferior product.  This one is more akin to a sherried Scotch where the wine notes become an integral part of the whiskey. ,Corti Brothers Exquisite Whiskey,Amador Distillery,7 yrs,American,2006,Bourbon,42.25,Kentucky,50,Specialty Stores,http://www.lawhiskeysociety.com/whiskey-profile/3194/Corti-Brothers-Exquisite-Whiskey

Sku,bminus,The nose is malty in a sort of Clynelish style.  It's got some coastal notes but also some floral.  The palate opens with sweet peat.  The peat is present but not overwhelming and the sweetness gives it a sort of candy coating.  The mouthfeel is light.  The finish is peaty and for the first time shows some grain whiskey notes. A minute later the sweetness is back adding a chocolate note to the grain like Ovaltine. This is a very solid blend with some good peat action and at 25 it's a no-brainer.

Sku,b,The nose has tropical fruit. The palate is pure peaty Laphroaig with a very light fruitiness that stays on the palate for the finish but the nasal exhale of the finish is pure peat.

Sku,bplus,The nose just explodes in peat smoke and bacon then you get the fruit like an orchard buried in peat. Pretty soon your nose has gotten used to the peat explosion and you're getting pears plums and grapes maybe even some floral notes.  The palate is softer than you would expect from the nose. The peat is thick and sharp and comes on first. Once you acclimate to it the sherry notes are sweet but not too intense and without any trace of sulfur. Despite the proof it doesn't feel too strong. The finish is well balanced between the strong peat notes and the sweetness of the sherry. B+/A- ,Laphroaig 1998 16 yo Signatory (The Whisky Exchange),Signatory,16 yrs,Scotch,1998,Single Malt,59.9,Islay,160,Overseas Specialty,http://www.lawhiskeysociety.com/whiskey-profile/3531/Laphroaig-1998-16-yo-Signatory-(The-Whisky-Exchange)

Andy,b,n:  wow.  A new obscure and fantastic wood.  Almost a wood candy p:  Typical American Single Malt maltiness with a winey finish.  A letdown after the nose but still good. B-/B ,Westland Garryana,OB,N/A,American,N/A,Single Malt,56.2,Washington,125,Specialty Stores,http://www.lawhiskeysociety.com/whiskey-profile/3934/Westland-Garryana
Ries,bplus,Great nose. Dark spice oak and spearmint with delicate powdered sugar sweetness. Nice distinctive oak influence with vanilla cream black pepper and no peat in the 2017 release. Middle has milk chocolate and overripe banana. The finish is very nice and long -  walnut black vanilla and waxy. Overall a bit strange and winey aspects (from the OR oak?) but that gets kudos in my book.  (B+/B Westland Garryana 2017 edition 2/1),Westland Garryana,OB,N/A,American,N/A,Single Malt,56.2,Washington,125,Specialty Stores,http://www.lawhiskeysociety.com/whiskey-profile/3934/Westland-Garryana
