One of the most opaque stouts I have seen with a rich burgundy red head to boot which had dissipated within minutes leaving behind a ebony jewel. A truly bold example and a textbook stout aesthectic.  Smell Chocolate! Creamy succulent mouth-watering cocoa hit me immediately followed by coffee some nutmeg oats concluding with a roasted hoppiness. Truth be told it is the most dynamic smelling stout I have tried! Aeration brought the coffee front and center revieling what seemed that of dark fruits (blackberries  black cherries etc.)  Taste My goodness we have a winner! This stout is remarkable! A frighteningly dynamic pallet hits you with haste; the most outstanding flavors being chocolate and roasted coffee with almost the consistency of cappuccino. Slight aeration within the mouth dug up overtones of blackberries honey and nutmeg which was a wonderful surprise. With a pallete as varied as this the breakfast stout could please just about anyone. Given its ABV rating the taste of alcohol was far  down on my list.  Feel Incredible and thick! An amalgamtion of creams and soups - almost as rich as steamed machiato. No alcohol burn at all going down easily. The warmth of this stout is strong sitting heavily in the stomach. It was  a comforting experience making it perfect for the bitterness of January.  Overall Founders has yet to deter my interest although this stout sticks out with such tenacity. I have yet to try a stout as exciting and open ended as this. Well done Michigan! 1

The first half of the beer is a solid 5 in every category. The only reason I dropped the overall to a 4.25 is because the second half starts to become a bit overbearing in terms of sweetness and heavyness. Not a beer I could drink back to back but still an exceptional beer

I prefer their Backwoods Bastard to this which is boozy but at least tastes like it is supposed to be.  While I always drink stouts rather warm I even tried a 2nd one of these cooler to give it another shot but it just doesn't do it for me.

This beer pours a dark mahogany brown with a light brown head that dissipates quickly to a ring around glass until finished.  Almost no lacing. Full lasting head and thick lacing would boost the score higher but personally I place 80% of my opinion on taste and this tastes great  Tastes of chocolate and coffee and the finish is moist alcohol with a hint of bitterness but not overbearing. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Aftertaste is gone quickly and leaves no lingering bitterness which is really nice. There is way less bitterness than the 60 IBU would indicate. The ABV is 8.30% which is pretty high. The beer doesn't taste that alcoholic but you definitely feel that alcohol after a glass. (Well at least I do). Overall a great beer with my only wish being a lesser price than the $12 I had to pay for a 4-pack.  Founders makes a great beer though and they deserve every penny.

Has a dark reddish brown color almost the appearance of cola. Thick fluffy tan head on top about the size of a thumb.  I smell a strong scent of roasted coffee beans toffee molasses vanilla dark chocolate and oats.   The taste has a strong espresso composition. Oddly I taste black olives but it's welcoming. Along with that there are notes of molasses vanilla raisins prunes roasted nuts and dark chocolate. Altogether pretty bitter but excellent. Feel delicately creamy.  A great treat.

I had one at fridge temp yesterday and I was profoundly disappointed. I have basically been saving the experience of trying this beer for later in my life since two years ago. Trying it for a second time now at room temperature and it is considerably more complex and balanced but idk just not blown away. I think I'd like KBS or CBS much more.  L: Incredibly dark. Just a trace of reddish cola color can be noted at the edges of the body when held to light but it's as dark as espresso. A thin film of cappuccino foam lingers on top and leaves sticky waves of lacing on the glass.  S: Roast coffee espresso black olives dark chocolate coffee molasses toffee prunes raisins vanilla milk oatmeal cloves and coffee. The coffee don't quit. It's a fantastic aroma but if you wish to appreciate it I hope you like coffee.  T: Salty as hell. Oddly enough there is just an edge of oatmeal flavor right before the anticipatedly huge coffee note which dances around the vanilla dark chocolate molasses toffee dried fruit and black olives all the way to the finish. It ends in almost entirely plain charcoal with a touch of unsweetened chocolate and coffee acidity. Alcohol is difficult to make out in all of that. If it was flat you could easily mistake it for a mildly sweetened cold brew. Btw when cold the only detectable flavors are the chocolate coffee and olives.  F: Super drinkable. Nice thickness. To my taste it could be just a smidge thicker and more syrupy but that's probably exactly how KBS is.  O: This brew reminds me very much of my first ever Russian Imperial Stout Old Rasputin by North Coast. A touch less salty and with much more coffee flavor it is also a delectable offering but not one that I see as superior at all. If anything I think I prefer Old Rasputin. In my honest opinion BCBS Narwhal Victory at Sea and even Founders' own porter all blow this out of the water. I'm still eager to try the barrel-aged editions but thus far I don't see what all the hype is about. 2

Aroma of roasted malt and coffee. Sweet malt balanced with roasted malt and coffee flavor and maybe some hopes to balance.  Smooth finish Medium to heavy bodied and goes great with heavy dishes (had it with Roast beef).  At  8.3% ABV one won't make your brain numb which to me is a plus.   A terrific strong stout!

First 'had' in 2015 though I've re-sampled it roughly a half-dozen times since then. Needless to say It's long overdue for a review.  This jet black stout comes equipped with a quarter-inch of frothy tan-coloured head that fades away within 90 seconds; the only significant remnants are a tight creamy collar and some foamy patches of bubbles floating upon the surface. Smells quite rich and rather sweet - I'm getting subtle notes of prune and date underneath a torrent of roasted malt goodness. Dark chocolate treacle and toffee are more prominent than notes of earthy coffee grounds; there are also minor aspects of ethanol vanilla coffee cake and herbal licorice.  Seriously yummy stuff - there's an array of competing flavours but that's fine by me because they melt together perfectly. Flavours of dark chocolate cocoa powder and oatmeal sweetness come through at first along with some molasses and caramelized malts. This is followed closely by fruity hints of fig and date - an important inclusion because we all know that fruit is a vital component of any balanced breakfast. The coffee grounds start to kick in towards the back end offering up an earthy bitterness as well as a pleasant roasted quality that will bring a smile to the face of any coffee addict. Coffee and chocolate both linger into the aftertaste almost completely masking the alcohol content. If I didn't need to drive to work in the morning I think I would actually be tempted to substitute this for my usual 8 AM java. In the vicinity of full-bodied with light carbonation that meekly nudges the surfaces of the palate to little effect - feels silky-smooth and soft in the mouth. I can't think of any other imperial stouts I've tried that went down the hatch with such sublime ease.  Final Grade: 4.38 a superlative A grade. Founders Breakfast Stout lives up to its hype. This is an excellent imperial stout with deep complex well-integrated flavour combinations - yet it's also one that I could drink on the regular. Ontario BAs should probably buy this one in bulk while it's still available - there really aren't any genuinely comparable alternatives (domestic or otherwise) at the LCBO right now. 2

It smells and tastes like a bold rich coffee with sweet sugar undertones. The feels like drinking a cold sweet coffee with a touch of mocha. Over all one of mt top five all time beers. If you love coffee as I do and love beer this is the perfect beverage.

Smell: For such a complex flavor the smell is very light. Some sharp sweet tones with a very subtle under tone of chocolate and oats.  Taste: This beer is probably my new second favorite under the locally brewed West O CocO stout for its bold and incredibly rich taste alone. The oats coffee and dark chocolate mix perfectly giving it a balance between sweet and bitter without being over powering. There's even a whisper of hopps in the mix but for those who dislike IPAs or overly bitter tastes this may not be a good beer to test the waters with. The after taste is on its own a unique feature and reminds me of biting into a piece of a Dove dark chocolate bar or taking a sip of Zak Wilde's Death Wish coffee.  Feel: The feel is heavier than your typical milk/cream stouts but not like chugging a bottle of maple syrup.  Overall: This beer is fantastic and pairs well with a bowl of actual oatmeal or toast; however light weights be ware of the 8.3% ABV and save this brew for after work. With the balance of sweet and bitter roasty oats and dark chocolate with just a touch of hopps and latte this brew is more than likely not for the beginner stout connoisseur but can easily become a favorite and coffee drinkers are sure to love this stout. Another tasty beer from my northern neighbors in Michigan. 1

It’s definitely thick with carbonation that is somewhat aggressive.  Flavors are chocolate and chocolate with some espresso notes intermingled.  Hops are well hidden as is unfortunately malt.     It is very good but the lack of notable malts is disappointing; the malt is why I love stouts.  Still a good beer overall though.

(4.5)  O: A very very nice stout. Just really does exactly what it says it will and what you hope it will. Looks nice enough and from there on out is great. A cohesive aroma-flavor package of coffee oatmeal with brown sugar and cinnamon chocolate and a bitter roast bite to finish.  Fabulous. I really wish I could get this one regularly. (4.5)

Appearance:  totally black with two finger of frothy dark-tan foam atop.  Dig it!  Smell: rich smooth coffee right at first segueing into a sweeter chocolatier maltier character.  Very nice indeed.  Taste:   tons of coffee at first transitioning into a more chocolate-based flavor at the end; it's got the same dynamics as the aroma.  Finish is deep and bitter very much like a dark chocolate.  Nicely complex and very tasty indeed.  Mouthfeel: rich body with a low-to-moderate carbonation; it's not super creamy but it's not bad either.  Overall: a very good beer indeed.  I am very happy we now get Founders distributed in Washington.

Pure jet black appearance and spawns a fine flat beige head that lingers for a minute or two after hitting the glass.  The nose is dominated by unsweetened espresso followed by extra dark chocolate and yeast. The aromas are not overbearing but pleasantly noticeable during each sip.   For the taste the dark chocolate begins to shine through along with the roasty espresso. As the beer warms after a few minutes notes of heavy cream and minute spikes of smoke and salt can be detected at the tip of your tongue. The flavors are all evenly distributed over a creamy texture creating a mellow and very drinkable stout thats not "in your face" by any means but has just enough complexity to lure you in for a second sip.

Founders' stuff is almost always a notch or two above average. This one is just not too appealing to me. Yes it smells of coffee. Yes it is malty. Yes there is chocolate. But the overall taste is of very bitter extremely dark chocolate that kind of bites at the back of the throat. Obviously from the reviews that kind of flavor appeals to many.  It looks lovely though. Oil black - viscous. The smell is... kind of acrid. It sure is not lacking in flavor. But it's not a flavor that I find pleasant. My ratings are on the generous side probably because the beer is from Founders.

Aroma of roasted malt and coffee but not heavily so.  There is something almost sweet in the background which I presume is chocolate.  Taste is roast malt/coffee on entry and this holds until the end.  Bitterness from whatever source is a bit more pronounced at the finish and in the aftertaste.  Full texture with balancing carbonation.  This one is better put together than most Stouts I've tasted.  The flavors are simple but so well knit together it gives off a sense of complexity even though it relies on simple flavors.  IBU is listed as 60 but I really don't taste that level of hopping present.  Brewer mentions imported chocolate which to me means dark bitter chocolate in the European style and while I don't actually taste that in this brew there is decidedly something extra in the overall flavor.  I understand why this is so popular.

Anyone can dump some coffee and chocolate in a beer but few can make it balanced and smooth.  Pours black as night with a nice 2 inch head.  The smell is buttery with chocolate and coffee notes.  Taste follows nose with a full mouthfeel of chocolate and coffee.  Pleasant mild bitterness complements the flavors nicely.  If there is a perfect marriage between beer coffee and chocolate this is definitely it.  So well balanced and buttery smooth.  After trying this for the first time I decided to see how well the breakfast thing would work.  Had it late morning with a bacon egg and cheese sandwich.  Don't judge me and yes it was freaking phenomenal!

Doesn’t really have any nuts but perhaps a hint of oats F: leaves a thick coating around the tongue with a lingering coffee taste  New to reviews so don’t rip me apart but I’ve been looking forward to trying this staple from Founder’s and it does not disappoint! Happily drinking it on Thanksgiving as well so all around a great beer drinking experience!

Dark tan head on very dark opaque body Thicker head with good coverage of lacing. Coffee and chocolate dominate on the aroma dark roasted backbone. Very balanced flavor of dark sweet chocolate slightly bitter but flavorful coffee and roasted malt. Fades away with all tastes in balance. Smooth somewhat creamy mouth feel on the dry side. A wonder for those who enjoy a heavily coffee infused stout with chocolate balance.

Taste is dark chocolate  espresso malt hint of bitterness and warmth of the ABV on higher side. Feel I thought was thinner than what would expect. A tasty beauty for sure. Not just hype. It's a great stout.

I almost like it better than KBS to be honest. Mouth feel is barely medium bodied. Taste is definitely coffe and cereal with some dark bitter chocolate on the back end. This really is an amazing stout. Shame it's rotating.

I’d buy a couple cases if it wasn’t for the fact that this beer drops off pretty badly over time.  Drink these fresh- don’t even think of aging it.

I don't detect as much chocolate as I do coffee but it might just be my taste buds. This is my go-to when I don't want to buck up for Dragon's Milk because it's 90%  as good at 2/3rds the cost and 2/3rds the alcohol content. Pick your poison. I'm too cheap to do Dragon's  Milk all the time so Founder's Breakfast Stout does right by me.  I really love it.

S chocolate vanilla overtones with a light hop note.  T Molasses chocolate start with a slightly bitter coffee finish. Very smooth overall. 8.3% abv means not a "drink 6 and let me know what you think " type of beer...  F very smooth mouth feel.  Needs to breathe in a frosty glass/mug for best results. Surprisingly good out of the bottle. Bottom line... if you find it buy it. One of the better stouts out there.

Pours black as pitch - looks like it ought to taste.  Attractive carmel head that lingers for a while.  Aromas of chocolate and roasted grains.  Taste - amazing.  Pleasant and rich on the front end - lingering bitterness on the back end.  The most flavorful Oatmeal Stout ever.  Aptly named - full of breakfast flavors.

Been in my fridge for a couple of months not sure how it was stored prior to my acquisition.  Beer is dark as FUCK. Nice mocha colored head fell pretty rapidly. Lazy lacing throughout session.  Aroma: tons of chocolate. Dark fruits. Plums. Hint of dust.  Flavor: heavy chocolate notes. Medium heavy slightly stale coffee notes. Medium sweetness. Just a touch of booze.  Medium bodied beer slightly warming alcohol sensation. Moderate carbonation.  Overall: Ironically I had the KBS over a decade ago and I'm just now getting around to trying the basebeer. It was pretty underwhelming. One dimensional chalky chocolate and stale coffee flavors dominate. This might have been mind blowing 10 years ago but there are some serious coffee stout and porter contenders now that this thing pales in comparison to. Still have love for Founders but in 2017 this beer doesn't deserve a second look. Could use a major refresher from the brewery--there are better ways to incorporate chocolate and coffee in the brewing process that would massively improve this beer. 1

A really nice thickcreamy feel that was perfect match for the intense flavor. Aroma was strong black coffee with a touch of cream and followed by come cocoa.

342,/beer/profile/1199/11757/,4.82,look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5,ForceForGood,I am comparing two bottles one bottled 9/26/17 and the other at 8/22/16 - having held on to this one for over a year now.  8/22/16: Pours black very carbonated - more than expected; tan colored foam. Aroma is sweet some chocolate and even a syrupy bourbon linger in the nose; not detecting any coffee... flavor may have faded during aging. Flavor and mouthfeel follow the aroma and over-carbonation. Not picking up any coffee flavor again other than the stouts dark nature granting similarity. Not a bad stout. ~7.5/10  9/26/17: Pours just as dark much less carbonation with less head. Aroma is COFFEE. I am amazed that these beers are the same. Coffee dominates and chocolate is quick to mix in giving me the impression of mocha. First sips are congratulated by an awesome rich dark chocolate and coffee blend. A masterpiece! 10/10!  In the end I am tempted to dump the rest of the older product as it seems to have much less character; not well aged I suppose? The 2017 release seems to have captured the coffee and chocolate more than I remember - having consumed these for a few years now. I continued to compare these side-by-side and the results are  confirmed. 1

The beer pours dense dark brown nearly black with red tinted mocha head.  No light penetrates this beer at any angle.  The head recedes to a thin ring and paper thin island.  Aroma is as advertised.  Chocolate coffee and roast malt abound.  Taste is slightly tangy sweetish malt and chocolate giving way to a bitter coffee finish.  Mouthfeel is full bodied adequately carbonated creamy and dry.  To pull of a perfect tasty dry finish in a beer like this is somewhat magical.  Overall great.  This beer is really good but anyone adverse to coffee or bitterness might want to wade in gently.  This presents itself more bitter than any 60 IBU in my recollection.  Note: This beer became more enjoyable and balanced as it warmed.  If you don't love the first few sips let it warms a bit and retry.

With a simple whiff the aroma of coffee and chocolate are there. The head has a creamy dark richness to it; and the flavor is bold but not overwhelming. The feel is one of relaxation. This is a stout truly deserving of its high rankings. And just to say I find that the more I drink Founders products the more I appreciate their brand.

Smells of coffee and molasses primarily--strong and sweet. Tastes of bitter chocolate slight coffee roasted malts molasses and a slight fruity sweetness that comes out as the beer warms. Chocolate lingers on the tongue. Thick mouthfeel but not too sticky and low carbonation. A great stout no question.

A slight alcohol after taste.  Prefer more chocolate/vanilla than what this offered.  Had from a 4-pack bottle.  Now I need to try KBS and CBS.

Incredible aroma of chocolate coffee caramel oak molasses. Taste is a mixture of dark chocolate and coffee with slight smokey notes. Very smooth and hides the high ABV incredibly well. Full bodied with a sticky heavy mouthfeel at first giving way to a dry feeling. Taste really lingers on palate. This and Bells Expedition are the 2 best non BA stouts I've had. Very very well done.

Nice solid two and one half finger mocha head thats hangs around.  Nice lacing.  No legs.  Dark coffee hits the nose first followed by semisweet chocolate and dark roasted malts.  Licorice.  Maybe some smokey molasses?  Taste follows the nose with bold dark roasted coffee bitter chocolate malts and some sweet grains.  Sweet oaty goodness.  Very smooth despite the bitter coffee.  Full mouthfeel with good carbonation.  Definitely not a stout for non coffee lovers.  Overall a good solid stout.  Big enough but not boozy.  Very drinkable.  Enjoy!  Cheers!! 
449,/beer/profile/1199/11757/,4.13,look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 2.5,Fizzer,This has a very good taste.  Sweet and coffee taste low carbonation and looks good too.  The problem is the richness this is not something that I would want to drink an entire 12 oz serving of.  This is like a very rich chocolate cake just a little bit is all you want or you will be sick and bloated.  There is no real bitterness to counter the sweetness and it becomes disgusting after too much.

Except I'm not that into it. It's not you it's me. I'm just not into the charred/burnt coffee thing and bitter finish. Guess I'm a sweet stout guy... BUT I still always buy you when I see you Founders BS - maybe it's better when it's first released. I always get it like 7 months into the year. I will keep trying you though...I will never give up!  Update: tried this again at room temp (65 degrees) and it was much much better. That burnt coffee bitter finish was gone.  very tasty beer. keep this one away from the fridge

Recently purchased from a reliable source this was bottled 7 months ago hopefully it’s ok at 8.3 percent.  Pours a hearty two finger milk chocolate colored head into my can-style glass.  The body is completely black with an odd amount of carbonation sticking to the side of the glass.  Looks beefy so far.  Yeah I mean the nose doesn’t get much better than this.  Huge coffee and enough chocolate to keep my mouth watering.  Fresh dry roasty bitter coffee is the dominating aroma on the nose but there is a sweet backbone to it.  It smells amazing.  The flavor is huge.  Coffee flavor is even more in your face on the flavor than in the aroma.  Not what I would call a sweet beer for the most part bitter coffee definitely dominates.  Finishes with a slight cinnamon flavor almost reminds me of mexican spiced coffee.  Chocolate is just barely here.  It’s a fantastic flavor though I would have hoped for something slightly more balanced as the aroma was suggesting.  The mouthfeel is alright.  The body is honestly a little thin for a beer that is supposed to be your breakfast.  Carbonation is just a tad below medium.  It works but something more chewy would be preferred.  The drinkability is very high for an 8.3% beer you don’t get any heat at all and it tastes fantastic.  Overall this is a pretty simple beer to review it’s loaded with coffee and not a lot else.  Again I would have hoped for something slightly more balanced and maybe a little more complex but what it does it does well.  Anyways it’s still a fantastic beer.  The appearance turned out pretty good.  I got lacing from the top to the bottom though it was somewhat inconsistent.  The head was average as was retention.  Overall a good looking beer nothing more. 1

Poured thick and dark like black gold with 2 fingers of lasting reddish brown cinnamon colored bubbly head that is quick to build with a swirl of the snifter. Smells and tastes of coffee and chocolate with slight notes of  roast and a hint of booze. Moderately  bittersweet and well balanced. Finishes clean with semi-sweet chocolate flavor. Mouth feel is full bodied  smooth and creamy with low carbonation. This one lives up to the hype and is great for breakfast! Pairs well with breakfast sandwiches and chocolate covered raised or cake donuts.

Nice head and some lace. Smells like coffee and chocolate.. Taste is still good but has lost half of the chocolate and coffee flavors. The feel is also thinned out a little with excellent carbonation still. Overall I can really enjoy this even though I feel more like I am drinking a coffee ale than the rich stout it was when brewed in September. This stout is best fresh within four or five months.

Smells of chocolate coffee. Nose is very sweet. Reminds me of lactose/milk stout sweet. Chocolate coffee roasty. What more is to say the beer is well known for a reason. Like a more affordable Trinity chocolate river.

It smells and taste of coffee (a STRONG black coffee). It has a smooth swallow but a deep throat aftertaste. For as much as this beer is hyped it is not better than Guinness.

More subtle which is fine. Taste does not disappoint for a double chocolate stout. You're not going to sit down and have several but great for a single beer. The initial taste is smooth for a strong beer with that kind of ABV. Aftertaste sticks around for awhile and is really pleasant.

It came from the last 4 pack out of a 3 case  haul I made over a year ago at 3.99 a 4 pack from my favorite ghetto grocery store.   It is holding up beautifully.  The roasted malt bitter chocolate and coffee are so beautifully balanced you just can't say anything negative about it.  It is wold class great.   Pours dark brown.  Generous head.  Perfect mouthfeel for a stout.  Great mouth retention.  I feel like I just finished a Starbucks and yes....I did drink it before noon :-)

L - Pitch black with a nice mocha head  S - Tiramisu goodness coffee cocoa powder nutty liquor very complex. Better when at room temperature  T - Very balanced taste. Coffee oatmeal roasty cocoa nib some nuts and a bit of grape almond. Quite dry light acidity.  F - Sharp carbonation but just the right amount for it to enhance the taste. Dry and a bit astringent mouthfeel.  O - Not an in your face stout but one of the most balanced double stout I've the chance to try. Certainly the best use of oatmeal I've had in a beer. Worth the hype.   After a second tasting I might say this is almost the perfect stout for me.

Tastes of medium-dark chocolate (I guess this is the bitter and sweet chocolate mix) and coffee with oat and cinnamon notes. The sweet chocolate taste just beats out the bitter taste which is quite lovely. The mouthfeel is velvety and rich but not overly so. Amazing.

Pours nearly pitch black opaque in the glass with a one finger brown head with great retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt coffee molasses and cocoa. Flavor is dark toasted malt with light char baking chocolate drip coffee light hop bitterness in the finish. Excellent creamy body with obvious oat contribution. A rich coffee forward stout with a dry profile that is more like a foreign export stout than an American one. Good chocolate flavor in the high cacao style drier and more bitter. If I actually drank beer for breakfast this would be one I would want quite often.

I can't justify anything less than a top-notch number.  Pours a nearly-opaque black with a fantastic three-finger head that slowly dissipates first to an inch of tan foam then to perfect foamy lacing all of the way down the glass.  This looks like a root-beer float head in a beer.  Terrific.  The aroma is subdued compared to some others of the style but it is all there for the smelling.  Roasted malts up front with coffee and chocolate right behind.  There is just a touch of spice and booze in the background.  This stout tastes fantastic and follows its nose but with more flavor than its aroma suggested would follow.  It delivers an unapologetic roasted malt-bomb balanced with bitter chocolate and coffee that is simply spot on.  The booze is there but it delivers a mixture of bite and sweetness not burn.  Then at the very end spice notes of cinnamon and anise tickle the back of the throat to complete the package.    Malt-bombs can be sticky messes.  This one isn't.  The bitterness and spice helps keep it from getting weighed down.  Meanwhile this thing is a paragon of full bodied chewiness.  One more tick of carbonation would have made the mouth perfect.    Overall I cannot think of an imperial stout that I would say I've tried and found clearly superior.  If you prefer the drier end of the spectrum you may not put this at the top of your list but by any objective measure this is simply fantastic especially for the price.  Highly recommended. 1

Bitterness balanced with warmth from the chocolate notes and some alcohol kick on the back. There's some sweetness but it's balanced by a nice dryness.  A little dark berry and cola tinge.   Feel is medium and great carbonation. There's small bubbles keeps the flavors dancing on the tongue nicely. It coats the tongue but not too heavy   Overall excellent. For some reason it's taken me years to try this and I finally did.

Smell: dominantly black chocolate lot of coffee smell but the alcohol was also present. Very viscous just like black motor oil.  Taste: chocolaty coffee taste. Roasted taste from the malt. Strong malty backbone.  Feel: full body very viscous and luscious. Excellent aftertaste that makes you want more of it. However the alcohol is very much present and one can taste it easily. And the high ABV can creep up really easily too.   An excellent brew the gift that comes from heaven. Even though the alcohol presence is strong the taste more than makes up for it. Very easy to fall in love with don't drink this in front of your other half she'll be red with jealousy.

Right out of the bottle it pour beautifully dark and with a tan head that has decent staying power with very good lacing down the glass.  About the only thing I didn't like was its scent.  Though I could pull out the chocolately notes and roasty smells it was just barely that I could do so (I had to work hard at it.)  After that it was all academic.  The feel was lightly carbonated with a silky smoothness that was very unique.  The taste was everything it was advertised to be (and then some.)  I do consider this a very good brew.  Maybe not the caliber others hold it high to but definitely worth the extra space in my beer fridge.

A violent pour yielded a nice dark tan head; nice lace.   Roasted coffee bean milk chocolate & faint cream notes in the nose; bold!   Medium thick creamy mouthfeel.   Cream roasted coffee bean & sweet cream flavors up front; mild hop bite on the finish. A touch too sweet but very enjoyable.

Poured out into my fancy pants Spiegelau stout glass. Oh my goodness does this beer look amazing. Smells like a rich creamy mocha. The taste at first is great too. About two thirds of the way through it goes downhill and becomes kind of bland and less enjoyable. Not my favorite but still a great stout.

Smells of roasted malts coffee and chocolate.  Tastes of same but less nuance- the flavors blend together into one solid taste without much complexity.  Mouthfeel is thick but not as thick as expected and overcarbonated by a mile.  Overall not a bad beer but astoundingly overrated.

762,/beer/profile/1199/11757/,4.89,look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75,weareallfalafel,Poured from the 12oz bottle into a snifter leaving some room to swirl it on the glass. Pours jet black with an inch of beautiful stable brownish head that dissipated slowly and left plenty of lacing and foam on the sides of the glass. Beautiful in the glass. Smell is of coffee then chocolate mocha and oatmeal. only complaint on the nose is I pick up the slightest metallic smell. Taste is spot on! Same qualities you pick up in the nose minus the metallic hint and all more pronounced with the full pat body carrying everything through and creating a full palate of very.. well breakfasts flavors! Cold brew mocha bittersweet cocoa oatmeal a touch of caramel sweetness and a full mouthfeel. Spot on and not at all less than I'd expect from Founder's.

Mild lacing. Wish it poured thicker  The aroma is a wonderfully sweet mocha with a sum of chocolate and roasted malts  The taste follows the nose it produces a fantastic chocolatey mocha flavor upfront  while leaving an espresso aftertaste. The oats add a creamy and  full bodied element   Overall I am beyond pleased! I can't get enough and will definitely be heading back to grab some more in the near future! Only thing I wish different was the body feel to be more full

A: The body is pitch black. The head is minimal with a brown to beige color. It has minimal retention as well and leaves no lacing. Would expect a bit more head in the is beer. S: The aroma is strong of cocoa coffee and toffee. It's incredibly awesome to find this aroma so sweet. T: The taste is amazing because it starts with the sweetness from toffee coffee and chocolate and uses the bitter end of coffee and dark chocolate to connect with the bitterness from hops that runs as high as 60 IBUs in this beer. The way these profiles connect is just amazing. M: Body is medium to medium high. Carbonation is a bit harsh but high as it provides a kinda velvety touch to the beer. O: I went through a lot of fight to find this beer and to finally have it. But thankfully to Portuguese Pedro from Académico I was able to finally drink it. Cheers to you man this is world class!

Opaque black in color with a reddish shade around the edge when hits the light the pour yields one finger of sudsy tan head that retains itself for a while before collapsing to some long-lasting foamy sheet on the surface it doesn’t go anywhere until the last sip lots of sticky lacing patch and spot appeared on the glass-side from time to time.  Very aromatic coffee and chocolate in a nose with varieties of scent ranging from espresso americano mocha yet milky and creamy chocolate. There is vanilla too as well as dark bread licorice burnt wood charred nuttiness and roasted profiles while hop same time provides notes of earthy citrus and subtle spice. The aroma is more open with prominent quality of coffee when the beer warmed.  The taste of espresso americano and mocha is in the lead with nicely sweet milky chocolate followed shortly. Then it is roasted malt with some astringency together with dark bread burnt wood charred nuttiness and some vanilla. Thanks to oat for the sweet soft and smooth. Those coffee flavors become much bolder and coat the taste buds before hop trying to add in its citric slight spice and earthy. Some bitterness and some astringency at the finish in which mostly derive from the roasted and coffee profiles. Overall it is sweet but not that overwhelming sweet since there are many layers of flavor to keep the ball in control.  The body is full and quite viscous but not too sticky with velvety yet silky smooth mouthfeel and some lively crisp carbonation through the palate dry finish.  Full of aroma full of flavor full of feeling this brew is not that kind of super complex but it is big and intense truly an enjoyment in glass. Alcohol is also well concealed making it not too hard to get along and great for sipping. 1

It is sweet and milky and its slightly chewy consistency is pleasant and full-bodied.  Prior review (12/4/16): Look 4.5 Smell 4.25 Taste 4.5 Feel 4.5 Overall 4.25 More sour than most stouts this beer's high level of carbonation plays well against the dark flavor of cocoa. It is thick and almost pitch black the head a rich tan. Very delicious beer that gets better every time.

791,/beer/profile/1199/11757/,4.47,look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5,HipCzech,Serving: 12 fl oz bottle ("bottled on 09/02/16") poured into a 9 oz Libbey Embassy snifter.  Appearance: Deep and inky with dark brown fringes - doesn't allow much light through. A short foamy head of tan foam recedes to spotty lacing.  Smell: Full nose of pleasantly roasting coffee beans and chocolate.  Taste: Big but balanced flavors of coffee (more pour over than espresso) both milk and dark chocolate molasses and hints of balancing bitter savory and tart notes through to the finish.  Mouthfeel: Velvety smooth slightly viscous and full bodied. Moderately carbonated with soft bubbles.  Overall: Amazingly balanced and flavorful. A big bold double stout without relying on any barrel aging for its depth and complexity.

Beautiful black rich brown head scents of chocolate and coffee tastes bitter and sweet feels thick like a bowl of oatmeal. It's great in just about every way.   But something is missing. Maybe it's been hyped too much. Maybe the price is just too high for me to feel comfortable buying it. Maybe I feel there are other great beers that do the thick high ABV stout/porter thing equally as good if not better generally for half the price.   Maybe something's just wrong with me.

Coffee comes through wonderfully in both the aroma and flavor. Not overwhelming and overdone like many coffee stouts. Bit of dark chocolate and roasted malt. It is nice and warming without being overly boozy or sweet as many imperial stouts are. This beer is fantastic and quite glad it is available at the local bevie.

It's a good beer to have on a holiday before breakfast.  Tulip or goblet is just fine.  But I give it a 4 because similar brews like dirty bastard ale and dragon milk beat it.  But one thing I love about this beer is the coffee notes tied in with a strong bold alcohol bite and the dark coffee texture that fits perfect during a cold winter.  However it tastes more potent than it is so it's missing the smoothness and it's almost priced too high to be considered a 5.

I say CAN BE because it depends where I get it and what batch its from. I've had lousy batches of it and incredible batches. The first time I tried it which must have been ages ago I distinctly remember having four glasses- one right after another. It was that good. When Its good its thick creamy and soft and has an abundance of coffee flavor. Its bigger beer at 8% but I find it sessionable. While KBS is also a great beer I tend to enjoy Breakfast stout more. There's just something great about it.

Smell: burnt malts and coffee beans.  Taste: very similar to smell. Sweet tasting coffee  Feel: incredibly smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation  Overall: an incredible beer that I will make sure to pick up whenever I can. If you like dark beers and you haven't had this yet you're missing out.

Smell: Smells great. Coffee caramel toffee nuts whiskey roasted malts.  Taste: Strong black coffee hint of caramel and nuts somewhat bitter finish. Taste like the perfect breakfast beer. Would be excellent for a morning of camping.  Feel: Good mouth feel. Doesn't feel cheaply made.   Overall: Very good stout lives up to hype. Would be an excellent pairing with bacon eggs and home fries. Let it warm up a bit and the flavors will intensify and reveal notes you hadn't noticed before. Getting Indian spices as well as vanilla and strong maple near the end of this brew. Will buy again at some point. 8/10.

Off-white head.  Smell:  I get over-the-top coffee out of the gate;  Not much else.  Taste:  Like the nose pretty much coffee and soy sauce to begin.  As the pour continues however these elements dissipate somewhat and I do begin to pick up on more chocolate and sweet elements; not a lot but some.  Feel:  Thick but smooth.  Overall:  My initial impression was that this wasn't for me but as it warmed I became a tad more interested.  Wouldn't mind revisiting.

One that I had was a perfect balance of chocolate stout and coffee and tasted fresh and crisp. The more recent one I drank had strong overtones of this really off flavor. I think the coffee they used for this second yucky batch had gone stale... It's also possible the shelf life isn't so great (maybe the CO2 in carbonation can eventually cause the dissolved coffee to change composition and "go stale"? I'm no expert in this but it makes sense C02 will stale beans so maybe...). It's also possible I was tasting tannins from cocoa nibs that had been steeped too long but the taste and smell was so much like stale coffee that's my primary hypothesis.

Strong coffee flavor with a smooth oaty mouthfeel and sweet chocolate finish.  Only with my state sold it in stores but apparently a baby eating oatmeal is offensive and doesn't belong on a beer bottle...live free or die!!

It's taste is great but for a BA score of 99 and "Bros" score of 100 I expected this to be my favorite beer I've ever had. Would have liked a bit more of a coffee taste but overall very impressed. Definitely a beer I don't think I'd get sick of. The pour was smooth and the dark color along with the chocolately smell was awesome.

Smells simple yet complex when found in a beer. Almost reminds me of being a kid and waking up to my parents making coffee. My curiosity of smelling something that I was too young to have. It takes me back to that smell. T- the taste is phenomenal it comes on strong starting with the coffee then comes chocolate with what I think is an oatmeal finish. The flavors are all there and they are brought on one by one from start to finish it's delicious one of my favorite stouts. F- rich and thick yet smooth left me what I think is an oatmeal/coffee taste. The texture of this beer and it's simple yet bursting flavors along with the order each flavor is introduced to the pallet is what makes it in my top stouts.

A large 1 1/2 think dark tan head formed and left a decent amount of lacing. The head didn't stick around as much as I'd like but I was using a Stein and not a glass made to keep a head around .  Bitter coffee is in the forefront of the nose with bittersweet chocolate riding on it's coat tails. You get a lot of roast in the nose promising great thing ahead.  Right out of the gates you are hit with loads of malt and black coffee bitterness. It's rich and a deep flavor that really coats your tongue staying for quite a while. On the tail end you get the bittersweet chocolate notes with hints of plums adding a very slight sweetness to the bitter roasty beer. The roasted character comes roaring back in the final seconds of the beer drying the finish somewhat leaving you wanting more. Not once is the beers high ABV ever detected.  This is possibly the most viscous beer I've ever had the pleasure of partaking in. It's sticky it fills the mouth and assaults your taste buds in a war of attrition like no other beer I've ever had.  I struggle to detect any noticeable carbonation even in this fairly fresh (bottled 9-01-2016) bottle. 1

Aroma: Smells like bitter dark chocolate light roast coffee mild cinnamon and malted grains. A gentle creamy oatmeal smell blankets the entire aroma.  Taste: Bitter and dry upfront with flavors of black espresso smokey burnt toast dark chocolate fudge connecticut tobacco and hazelnut. There's a gentle resinous spicy hop flavor in the background. Things gradually get sweeter as you work your way through the beer as notes of oatmeal vanilla beans dairy creamer and caramel become more pronounced - however don't be mistaken it is still quite a bitter beer - and at no time does the sweetness become dominant over the other bitter flavors.  Feel: Very filling and satisfying. Thick and viscous yet still paradoxically slugabble and drinkable. Hearty very much like a meal in a glass. Low carbonation heavy body. Alcoholic heat is slightly noticeable but understated and actually very pleasant providing a nice warming sensation as the beer goes down.  Overall Comments: Very enjoyable. A really nice presentation of flavors here ranging from nuts to grains to coffee to chocolate to hops to spices... although it packs big flavor it's intensity never really becomes taxing or exacerbating to the palate. Highly drinkable and thirst quenching for such a flavorful almost 8.5% imperial stout. 1

(bottled on 9/1/15) So it's aged over a year on a shelf in the light. I'm not a real big stout drinker this is one of the first I have ever had. The beer poured with a nice tan head that dissipated quickly. The beer was almost black. It's a very appealing beer looks wise. It smells of oak chocolate and bourbon. The more and more I smell this beer bourbon just keeps popping out at me. I cannot really taste the coffee like most say they can. I can really taste chocolate malt and the light bitterness of bourbon as it is going down. An overall pleasant tasting beer with a smooth finish. The 8.3ABV helps the feels as well! This was a pleasant beer. Although my experience with his beer has seemed a lot different than other reviews It was still pretty good and I would recommend. I'm not sure if my experience has anything to do with the age but I doubt it. I will be buying a new 4-pack in the near future. 1

Taste is a bitter coffee/espresso.  For someone who loved both beer and coffee this is a goft from G*d!  Flavors are rich true and lasting.  Carbonation is decent and mouth-feel is fulsome.  A world-class beer!

Aromas of bourbon chocolate and coffee. Mouth feel is significantly thinner than BCBS but still satisfying and warming fills the mouth and pallet with complex flavors of chocolate oats and coffee that are complimented by the bourbon not overwhelmed by it.

Right out of the fridge I couldn’t help not tasting mmmmm.  I then restrained myself to let it warm up to get all the flavors.  Bottled 8/12/2016.  Poured into a Tulip glass.  Smooth dark pour a finger’s worth of head khaki color.  After diminishing rim head lasted throughout the tasting.  Rim head?  Is that accepted terminology?  ha.   Smells are coffee malts and cocoa.  Taste of bitter sweet chocolate coffee malts and caramel upfront.  Finishes/lingers with bitter coffee and chocolate  Mouth is a full bodied feel smooth and light carbonation.  Soft alcohol feel no boozy ending.  Awesome beer one of my favorite.

They're both very fine and I'd be happy to have either one but Speedway edges this one out in terms of flavor. Founders is heavier on roasted malt flavor and less chocolate or coffee Speedway is heavier on chocolate/coffee and sweeter all made doubly impressive by the fact that it's 12% abv yet tastes smoother than this Founder's to my palate. They're dead even in terms of feel and appearance the Founder's is the clear winner for aroma though. Speedway is bitter and metallic whereas Founders has maybe the best coffee stout aroma of any beer I've ever experienced. This is definitely a top-tier stout and worthy of all the accolades also cheaper than Speedway but on taste alone I prefer the AleSmith.

A very potent simple yet profoundly flavored brew that is as smooth as silk.  Great chocolate base flavor with a perfect bitterness that is nicely matched with the roasted malts coffee and chocolate.  I have been seeking out for years. A grail acquired.

It's really a beer you need to be in the mood for I think.

Aroma is an intense coffee roast chocolate caramel vanilla and wood with some noticeable alcohol. Taste starts with roasted coffee and gives way to layers of chocolate dark fruit and vanilla with a sharp hop bitterness. Slight astringency. Mouthfeel is medium and silky with a low carbonation. Mild alcohol warmth present. Finishes with some spice and slick feel in the tongue

This is not something you pound like a light lager or pilsner but a thick beer coffee for you to sip on and relax.  I have to say this is comparable to Parabola for me but most people will disagree and prefer the latter.  However this is a great imperial stout not too expensive nor boozy but simple and enjoyable.

Rich aroma of coffee chocolate charred brown bread and caramelised sugar. Tastes like it smells. Some treacle adds sweetness and balance. Very smooth and viscous. Goes down easily. The overall experience was good but I somehow expected more given the hype.

Inky-black topped by a 1-finger tall khaki head with good retention. Lacing all the way down the glass is very good.  Nose has prominent notes of black coffee cocoa  and sweet malts.  Flavors feature sweet caramel malts molasses and brown sugar balanced extremely well with bittersweet chocolate up front.  Coffee bitterness toasted nuts and earthy notes come in later on leading to a finish that lingers with coffee and cocoa on the palate.  Mouth-feel is medium heavy a big beer but surprisingly easy to drink. Full-bodied but not quite as crushingly weighty as other stouts; very smooth and satisfying without being overwhelming. Carbonation is fairly light and the alcohol provides a pleasantly soothing warmth without ever being boozy.  A much-ballyhooed beer that delivers on the hype big time. All the flavors are remarkably balanced with different notes coming in and out of focus as the beer warms and the nutty undertones and smooth body from the oatmeal only make this even more appealing.  I suppose if someone didn't like coffee or chocolate or big malty stouts one might not be pleased with this one but if any of those things are to your liking this might be in your wheelhouse. 1

Smell is heavy coffee/oat with a black licorice to it.  Taste is so full of chocolate and coffee it is very nice. There are hints of licorice in there and also a soft alcohol feel. The finish is of lingering coffee/chocolate with a  mild alcohol hit but very very pleasant. I really like this beer next one I am going to let rest at room temp to see how the flavors change I think this could get better with a little warm up.  Check it out if you want a great beer.

One of the best beers I have had the pleasure to drink. Very well balanced chocolate and coffee right up front with a smooth oat and alcohol Finish.  Poured a deep opaque and a nice 1 finger tan head. Smelled just like the label says. Oatmeal chocolate and coffee.

No light escapes the surface of this beer.  Nose is upfront with earthy roasted coffee baker's chocolate and nuts. Mild cherry butter and coconut sugar open up as the beer settles. I can relay no more on the topic of taste other than the fact that this beer is essentially an artisan coffee-soaked chocolate cake in liquid form.

Nice lacings throughout as I drink the beer.  Flavors of roasted coffee chocolate dark roasted malts and molasses-like sugars dance about and trade places with each sip.  While it's mouthfeel is soft and velvety it's not quite as heavy bodied as I would expect it to be.    To me this beer has long been a trail-blazer perhaps pioneer of it's time and definitely a game-changer in the beginning years of the craft beer boom.  It's still a solid offering the only difference between now and 10 or so years ago is there is now a lot of competition some better than this.  It's still the same great Founders Breakfast Stout but considering everything else out there it's easy for me to view this beer as slightly overrated.

Plenty of sticky lace left on the glass  Smell is dark roasted malts and chocolate with plenty of coffee/espresso. Undertones of vanilla oats and maybe even cinnamon give fantastic complexity.  Taste is equally as complex. Actually so good it's hard to drink this a a slow sipper!  Coffee chocolate vanilla and even some smoke. Complexity continues to impress as it reaches temp.  Feel is really smooth. Beer coats the entire mouth and flavors last a min before fading. Sweet and heavy with just enough bitterness to make it balanced.

Despite being very robust and chocolate the beer is remarkably balanced with bitter notes that round things off.  No detectable alcohol.  Excellent head retention with some lacing.  Body is as heavy as motor oil so its a bit of a sipper.  One of the best

Pours an opaque black oily body that audibly glugs from the bottle revealing slight glimmers of ruby as it catches the light. A dense one-finger in height dark tan coloured creamy head fades quickly to a thin cap and sturdy collar leaving behind light soapy lace.  The nose is dominated by freshly ground dark roasted espresso beans. Underneath a robust mixture of dark roasted malts milk and dark chocolate hints of oats and traces of creamy vanilla are prominent but play only supporting roles in comparison to the coffee. Taste roughly follows suit leading with intense full-bodied dark roasted coffee profiles upfront sweetened slightly by milk chocolate and light oatmeal impressions. Around the mid-palate roasted barley darker bittersweet chocolate and hints of vaguely fruity malt follow before coffee builds once again towards the finish. In the mouth a medium to full-body and appropriately low levels of fine carbonation give a luxuriously rich and slick feel with the addition of oatmeal noticeably assisting a wonderfully silky-smooth creamy texture. Towards the end suggestions of earthy woody hops are swallowed by plenty of bittersweet dark chocolate espresso beans and dark roasted malts to finish dry on the palate with only a hint of alcohol warmth.  Overall this is a fantastic beer. Undoubtedly the majority of the flavour is dominated by that of the coffee and chocolate it is brewed with but both additions are incredibly well-balanced and neither one is allowed to step too far above the other. The roasted malt profile underneath may not be hugely complex but it's dark rich and robust enough to provide a fantastic background for the two main elements to shine. Recommended. 1

Pitch black brew with a coffee brown head about a half a finger thick that rapidly dissipated. Smell changes from whiff to whiff sometimes coffee sometimes chocolate and sometimes like a freshly opened feed bag of oats. Taste hits first with black coffee and bitterness rolls into the sweet oats and finishes with a dark chocolate flavor with a hint of booze. Flavor does linger for quite a while afterwards. Feel is creamy and rolls about nicely with virtually no carbonation.

Pour into a glass and let it come into its own after 10 minutes.  The warmth from your hand will activate additional notes of earthy coffee and rich chocolate.  Just a great stout.

Appearance is black with a tan head that dissipates quickly. Good carbonation too. Aromas of coffee chocolate and some malt sweetness.  Tastes are big bitter coffee and chocolate predominantly along with some earthy bitterness. Nice smooth mouthfeel from the oats that lingers will with a pleasant carbonation.  Overall an amazing beer that is one of the better coffee beers I've had.

Roasted coffee chocolate vanilla smoke and booze.  Feel - chewy silky mouthfeel that lingers.  This beer is outstanding. So complex yet drinkable. The coffee hits hard but it's still sweet and chewy.

Aroma hits those chocolate and coffee notes when fresh starts to take on more of a RIS dark fruit bitter vibe as it ages.  Taste is plenty of chocolate first super smooth oatmeal goes a long way here hides the alcohol.  More bitter with age less coffee.  When you talk about non barrel aged stouts this one is easily at the top of the pack.  So happy we get this in Nevada now.  The ultimate beer to start a tailgate.

I took it from my fridge and let it sit out for 15-20 minutes. I poured it into a nonic pint glass. The color was that of a deep espresso with a light brown head that quickly subsided. The nose was rich with chocolate an I picked up some molasses notes. Not being a fan of very bitter beers I was very pleasantly surprised that in spite of it being toward the higher IBU range there was a nice balance probably due to the oats used so the bitterness didn't overshadow all the other marvelous flavors. It was light and rich on the to gnu at the same time and left some nice lacing on the glass. Definite notes of chocolate and coffee. This could turn me into a stout fan.

The look is black with a tan head that dissipates rather quickly. The smell is coffee coffee and more coffee. There is also some dark chocolate and oaks. The taste is amazing! The coffee and chocolate is blended nicely and tastes like nice expresso. The feel is good. This stout is not too thick but I am glad this is not a thin liquidy stout. Overall this is very a nice coffee stout. In will definitely be buying another 4 pack.

Just what I want to see from a stout.  S- Lots of coffee and dark chocolate malts in the nose.  T- Follows the nose. Tons of dark chocolate and coffee flavors even more than one would expect from the aroma. Outstanding.  F- Medium to thick body.   O- This beer lives up to the hype and it's one of my favorite stouts I've ever tasted. If you want loads of coffee flavor in your stout this is for you.

Like dark drip coffee. No head to speak of. But somehow there's still residuals left on the glass. Go figure.  Nose is faint but rich coffee and dark chocolate come through. Good flavours just wouldn't mind them asserting themselves a little better.  Flavour takes those notes and runs. Rich creamy dark chocolate and silky black coffee drive this whole thing weaving in and out of one another wonderfully. Body is just the light side of heavy and oily/silky smoothe.   This is what it says it is that is if it says that it is good shit. Because this is good shit. From @WesMantooth's awesome NBS BIF #3 box. Thanks Corey!

Aroma of chocolate coffee roasted malts - very pleasant aroma. Taste doesn't disappoint - the chocolate and coffee come through and the alcohol doesn't overpower the drink. This is one of the best readily available stouts!

Poured into a pint glass a nice and thick stout that doesn't try to jump out of your glass. I think the hops and roasted malts do a great job hiding the  8.3 abv. Not overly sweet and surprisingly easy to drink for the high alcohol content. Founders brewery is one of the great things about living in Michigan.

Pours pretty much black with a super-solid tan head.  I could have placed a pound coin on this head and it would have held for a couple minutes.  Lacing sticking all over.  Nose is very mild compared to expectations.  A bit fruity...like the fruity coffee notes from varietals like Kenya AA and Ethiopian Yirgacheffe...and some ice coffee.  Bit not a lot.  Taste is better with the initial feeling of sweetness (probably more from the heavy mouthfeel) fading to dry almost ashy with lots of coffee on the finish.  Coffee/ashy notes last a while.  Mouthfeel is heavy.  Carbonation is a bit high for the style IMO.  Overall a very good beer but I don't rate it quite as high as some.  It is extremely close to a homebrew I make which may make it less exciting/different to me.

Very aromatic with complex coffee chocolate and oat smell and taste. A bit of a bitter aftertaste for a stout and just a trace of the alcohol. The taste is overshadowed by the overwhelming body that overflows the palate. Delicious!

Nose has coffee bitter chocolate creaminess coffee grounds. Body is viscous and thick. Palate has similarity to the nose coffee bittersweet chocolate some burnt coffee grounds. A great beer if a little on the expensive side.

Smells and tastes like 3/4 French roast coffee mixed with 1/4 dark chocolate with a slightly bitter finish.  I'm normally not too much of a heavy stout fan because I find them a bit sweet and bog down my drinking after awhile But I really like this one because of the soft bitterness.

Pours a classic inky black with a decent kakhi brown head. Coffee chocolate roasted oats and caramel with a similar aroma. Mouthfeel is full with a sticky finish.  Overall I really enjoy this stout more than many of the sought after brewery only stouts.

Smell is medium coffee bitter chocolate and sweet milk chocolate. Bitter oats. Some earthy hops. Ghiradelli 72% cacao chocolate squares.  Taste follows smell: coffee bitter chocolate first faint touch of sweet milk chocolate some earthy hops oats caramel fudge.  Mouthful is decent. A touch over-carbed for my personal preference for style.  Overall: awesome beer. One of the first crafts I ever had. Always always nice to have.

The aroma offers bittersweet medium roast coffee dark chocolate milk chocolate earth caramel oats and brown sugar.    The palate smacks of dark chocolate milk chocolate baking cocoa caramel burnt toast oats and dark roasted coffee lingering long into the finish of wood smoke dark chocolate and heavily roasted coffee.    The mouthfeel is medium-full filling and smoothly carbonated.    This one of the best chocolate-coffee-stouts you will on the shelves period.  One of the best Founders beers and one of the best coffee beers period.

Smell full flavored nice sweet chocolate malt big roast and punch of coffee bitterness. Greatness.  Taste is similar to the aroma with a sweeter malt profile balanced by the coffee and hop bitterness.  Great blend of chocolate roast coffee and just a little earthy hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is crisp moderately carbonated with solid lingering finish.  Overall a style defining beer for coffee stouts great full flavors and huge coffee presence without destroying the rest of the beer.

Initially a thick two finger coffee brown head that dissipates to about a half finger then sticks around. Tons of brown lacing on the glass.   Smell is a pungent aroma of coffee and bakers chocolate. Some cocoa plain oatmeal and alcohol undertones.  Sip. ... Taste is initially coffee - but its a thick coffee flavor like an espresso or cubano. Then as the flavors start to develop in your mouth it tastes like you took a bite of fresh oatmeal with chocolate and molasses in it. Rich thick decadent. There is a mild acidic bitterness at the end of the sip like black coffee. Bit of spice and alcohol on the aftertaste before you get that left with a rich chocolate oatmeal chip cookie flavor. ...  Savor. Repeat.   Feel is incredible. Medium carbonation provides a tingle on the tongue initially. The beer itself - thick roasty and decadent.  This beer is amazing and it never gets old. Also for proper glassware - a coffee mug is perfectly acceptable for drinking this beer. 1

Small head light cocoa brown quickly dispersed.   Smell: equal notes of dark roast coffee and dark chocolate smells malty carmel thick cream.   Taste: A hair lighter than dark bitter chocolate. Bitterness offset by thick carmel malts with chocolate and coffee mingling pleasantly.   Mouthfeel: thick lasting carbonation dissipates (but not fully) nicely after swishing. Sweet aftertaste of bitter chocolate cocoa beans bitter dark coffee beans in a newly-opened coffee bag.   Very smooth. 60 IBUs? Tastes like <30. Dangerously drinkable but you want to savor every sip. Warms the whole body pleasant bitter malt aftertaste.

Roast coffee chocolate roasted malts. Towards the end there are hints of molasses and oatmeal I didn't pick up on the nose.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy like an oatmeal stout should be.  The high ranking is legit. This is a really good stout.

Why I like this so much is that it doesn't taste like its 60 IBU. Very smooth very dry very roasted. Don't understand how 60 bitterness gets concealed from my hop aversion.  Deservedly so this is on the "1001" list.  Tasted again on 4/27/16... I could say more but I cannot improve on the review... nor can Founders improve this stout. And I suppose that is why they have introduced so many variations on the theme.

Great lacing though.   The bouquet is assertive. Massive coffee and chocolate. Roasted malts caramel and a slight hint of dark fruits.   The taste is very similar to the nose massive chocolate and coffee being the protagonists. Well balanced beer it never ceases to be bittersweet at the same time but it starts mostly sweet and it finishes mostly bitter. Lots of roasted malts. A little boozy vanilla hints of molasses and prune. The aftertaste is very long and chocolate-predominant.  Thick mouthfeel chewy smooth silky.   The intensity of flavors in this beer may be unmatched. The same goes for the quality of its different notes.  World class beer for sure.

L:  Pours an inky black... the color of my  heart with a thin brownish head.  S:  Coffee roasted and delicious... cocoa beans and smoky goodness.  T/F:   Hearty roasted malts... espresso and chicory.  Chocolate is in the background with coffee forward.  Thick and creamy but also smooth.  Low carbonation as expected.  O:  One of the leading examples of the style... and a yearly treat when it's released.  Just a fantastic stout... all the complexity and flavor you look for and easily drinks like a meal.. or better yet a dessert.  Delicious and one of Founders best.

Nose is coffee chocolate malt and dark fruits.  Taste is dark chocolate and fruits coffee roasted malt in a sooooo very balanced fashion that not one is overpowering.   Bitterness is controlled.  I was expecting a heavier oily feel but this has a nice moderate and creamy body.  This beer is extremely drinkable . . .  like liquid sex. :)

Pours black with a nice sand colored head that dissipates quickly.  Great roasted coffee/chocolate aroma.  So many roasted/toasted flavors going on: coffee malts oats with a chocolate finish.  Wonderfully coats your mouth.  Almost feels like you can chew it..  One of my favorites!

A gentle swirl revives the head throughout the glass. Smell is coffee dark ripe fruits roast malts and chocolate. Taste follows. Not overly sweet. Pleasing bitterness in the aftertaste.   Nicely rich on the tongue but not overly thick or viscous. A creamy medium feel. If you're used to 13% syrupy bombs this might feel thin by comparison but it's spot on for this style/ABV. Great stout that brings together a lot of elements in perfect harmony.

Minimal head the color of espresso foam.  S:  Coffee coffee burnt sugar yeast  burnt toast and more coffee.  Enough said.  T:  Tastes of bitter chocolate and coffee sweet bread or grains and burnt smoke.  Highly savory and bitter offset by a creamy sweet undercurrent that fills the mouth and leaves a lingering milky sweetness.  The smoke flavor is a bit stronger than I'd like it on an otherwise well-balanced and delicious beer.  F:  Silky and thick with tightly structured bubbles.    O:  Really big bold and tasty.  Love that the chocolate coffee and grain flavors are so strong but blended in just the right proportion to create this awesome brew!

Sweet light roasted coffee on the nose balanced by some thick earthiness. Taste of sweet milk chocolate and lots of coffee this is truly a breakfast stout. As it warms it becomes deeper and more complex malts and a bit of booziness on the end. The mouthfeel is on the thicker end as one might expect with a bit of an lingering oily feel. Overall it's a little too one sided to be considered one of the all-time greats for my personal tastes being quite dominated by coffee both in the taste and olfactory departments but nonetheless it is quite delicious.

A few days ago I did drainpour another beer for the same reason. Which automatically makes me skeptical on this one which I have been waiting a long time to get my greedy little hands on. Let's taste it. Well this is not really bad. Now I get some malts too maybe a sweet dark fruit component. My problem with this is that I hate cold coffee. And I don't want to boil this beer. What can I say about it? Maybe I don't like the style but this is a major disappointment. Will not buy again. But is just my problem. I guess.

Smells like freshly-toasted split oatmeal a pot of fresh coffee and chocolate hazelnut candy.  There's a lot going on here and it's all astoundingly tasty. The main flavor is thick creamy and heavy like a Vietnamese iced coffee and the oats dominate the body. The finish is a riptide of blackstrap molasses with notes of potato starch nutmeg and a little black pepper giving way to an aftertaste of bitter cappuccino foam nutella and hashbrowns. The balance on this is just about perfect - no single element dominates and each flavor is thick and hearty enough to make not one bit about this beer be underwhelming or watery.   This has been one of my favorites for a long time but it's also been a while since I've had one. Yep still freakin' awesome. It pairs well with all kinds of heavy high-calorie food but right now I'm having it with Texas jalapeno chili and it's just stupid how well they work together. 1

Head has a brownish coloration very appealing for a stout. Solid black can't see through this beer in the least bit.   S: The smell is a little unremarkable. You can get hints of the chocolate/coffee flavor but its mostly the roasted malts that come through. A good smell subtle but nothing that jumps out to grab you at first. This is probably one of the few beers that has its looks get your attention more than the smell.   T: What can I say. The roasted combination of the classic stout flavors is second to none. Chocolate and coffee and cereal malt all work together in the brew to create the quintessential stout. Truly the best in class. Flavor is consistent and powerful from front to back from first sip to last.   F: Smooth as anything but certainly not a beer to drink quickly. Its thick enough to float a spoon on and it feels like that in your mouth. The smooth slightly alcoholic element sticks in your mouth but not in a bad way at all.   O: My favorite beer. I save it for special occasions mostly in the winter. 1

L: Deep dark brown that is approaching pitch black with a nice half finger espresso colored head. Lacing is left on the glass as you sip. Looks like a full glass of freshly brewed coffee.  S: Immediately hit with coffee chocolate vanilla roasted malt maybe some caramel.   T: Really full black coffee flavor followed by a nice chocolate bitterness - some vanilla in there also. A roasty dry-ish finish.  F: Nice full bodied beer that suits a stout perfectly. Feels like silk.  Overall this beer is awesome. There are few beers that I would comfortably buy a case of but I just may have to go out and get one! Cheers.

S: Smells amazing! Rich and malty with big notes of chocolate and fresh ground coffee  T: Big toasted malt flavor. Chocolate and espresso are prominent with hints of tobacco and dark fruits. Just enough hops to balance it out.   T: Smooth and creamy full bodied. Maybe a little light for the style  O: Fantastic beer! Not much more to say. There is a reason why its so highly rated its one of the best beers around.

(L) Very dark almost black with a thin tan head.  (A) Pleasant aroma coffee and chocolate  (T) Taste is dark chocolate some coffee and some oat and a hint of alcohol. Not too bitter.  (F) Nice moderate carbonation a tad creamy smooth and easy drinking.

But once it's in the glass it's just an impenetrable black. Only about a quarter of a finger of brown head even after a pour down the middle. It dissipates pretty quickly too but an outer ring remains that offers pretty decent lacing.  S: Coffee and malts mostly. A small bit of alcohol in there as the head dissipates.  T: Heavy on the coffee and the dark chocolate up front. Towards the back end buscuity malts and a really nice hint of oats. Alcohol is also definitely present it's not overpowering or anything but it's there. Flavors are very pronounced and very delicious.  M: Medium mouthfeel really smooth. Very light carbonation. As you swirl it around and the head comes back a little it gets noticeably creamier for me. Really well balanced on this end.  O: Solid beer. Very good taste not too overwhelming but pretty strong and forward. Balanced and smooth mouthfeel. Aside from the head which goes away too soon it's really nice looking in a glass. A bit alcoholic at times (on some sips more than others) but for such a high ABV beer it's not so bad. Definitely a high quality and easy drinking beer I'd recommend this for anybody who enjoys stouts. 1

Beer pours super thick and dark almost like maple syrup and settles in the glass black with a tan head. Head dissipated fairly quickly but left a thin ring of foam that never fully went away and TONS of thick heavy lacing. Smell and taste both have huge flavors of dark coffee some bitter chocolate and faint alcohol. Feel is especially impressive; it's super smooth creamy and thick. Very easy to drink despite the big bold flavors. Definitely one of the best stouts I've tried yet.

That being said it pours a very dark dark brown practically black with a thin light brown head and some lacing. The aroma hits you of dark coffee with every other imaginable malt character. Chocolate oatmeal and biscuits are also prevalent in the taste but so does the alcahol aftertaste that does not last. This is a great after dinner sipping beer in my opinion or one that can be enjoyed with a heavy BBQ especially with beef or pork. You could even enjoy this with a ice cream dessert. I'm glad I finally found this and the baby on the label rivals the Gerber baby as the best in all the history of product marketing.

L- very dark brown some might even say black. Maybe not quite as black as a quad but close. Very very thin dark brown head. If side pour than head is barely noticeable.  S- chocolate and coffee. Strong smell.  T- distinct chocolate coffee and malt in that order. Chocolate more than anything and lots of it along with lots of coffee. Aftertaste is all chocolate.  F- syrupy and mildly heavy. Not as heavy as I was expecting but its still a double chocolate oatmeal stout so don't expect to need more than 2. It will fill you up. O- excellent beer one of my all-time favorite. Right up there with the KBS.

Bottle purchased in early January 2016 poured into Guinness stout glass.  L: Very dark brown almost black. Two finger head with decent retention leaves slight lacing and a cap.  S: Coffee cocoa malt but can't really pull oats out of it.  T: Taste tends to follow nose: Coffee is dominant followed by unsweetened chocolate. Malt backbone. A tiny bit of alcohol at end but not offputting.  F: Medium bodied light carbonation. Neither sticky nor overly dry. Very well balanced.  O: As always this is very very solid. I think it is overrated *a bit* but you can't go wrong with it.

It's new to Southern California maybe my expectations were too high. I much prefer Victory at Sea or Speedway Stout to this. Just too thin and slightly acidic. Some surprisingly boozy notes for only 8% ABV too.

Poured from a bottle dated 09/04/15 into a tulip at 55 degrees F.  Moderate pour produces a three finger tan head. Settles down soon into a thick skin with plenty of lacing.  Beer itself is deep opaque brown bordering on black.  Aroma is coffee grounds and wet pennies.  Something went wrong it seems.  Flavor is slightly lactic with a dash of sourness up front. Coffee comes on strong along with bitter chocolate.  Slightly acidic finish with a hint of oatmeal  (more in the mouthfeel than on the palate). A little alcohol heat and flavor as well.  Speaking of mouthfeel  this beer is medium-bodied with an acrid bite offset by oatmeal smoothness.  That sharp edge fades soon but is unpleasant on the first few sips.  This is from the first batch distributed to Southern California so my expectations were high.  Sadly  they were not met.

Its a shame cause I only really started to enjoy this when it got to the right temp. Regardless it was a nice thick black full bodied stout with a nice balanced flavor. Chocolate and coffee were delicious and there's almost no sign of the alcohol.   Update:  Just opened a bottle with 6 months on it that was aged in less than ideal conditions. The result is an odd smell that is kind of soapy. However the taste is still very good. Tons of chocolate coffee and its bitterness arriving later good creamy oatmeal base.  The body is not huge but its oily and smooth. Easy to drink for breakfast lunch or dinner!

I was just finding out the complexities and delights of craft beer and this one was readily available but definitely unlike any other beer I'd had before. It opened me up to the world of high-ABV rich and robust stouts which have become some of my favorite beers to try. Silky smooth creamy and loaded with chocolate and roastiness.

I have had this stout before and am a big fan. I decided it was time for a review.  It is very dark almost black with a nice dark tan head.  To my nose it had a heavy coffee aroma which is not a bad thing at all.  Taste: Wonderful. Taste of chocolate coffee just the right amount of sweetness that has just a touch of bitterness that suits this brew well.  It is nice and  smooth with an ample body. It is one of my top oatmeal stouts. I wouldn't mind having one of these hearty buggers at breakfast sipping slowly on a cold winter morning.

Appearance: Pours a solid opaque black with 2 fingers lasting tan head.  No visible carbonation. Retains a ring of than with very nice lacing.  Smell: Heavy bitter roast.  Coffee and oat-forward. Darkness pervades. Coffee is really prominent on the nose.   Taste: Roasty sweet arrival transitions to a somewhat sweet and surprisingly resinous hop-driven bitterness almost immediately then a robust malt-driven bitterness of roasted barley oats coffee and baking chocolate.   Mouthfeel: Lighter side of full-bodied.  Moderate carbonation.  Only slightly slick.  Overall: Wow.  This is a really excellent coffee and oat-forward roasty stout. It definitely lives up to the hype. Alcohol is totally hidden.  4-pack worthy. This is to stouts what Sumatra is to coffees - dark and dirty - but in a good way.  Had they not said this was Sumatra in this it probably would have been my first or second guess. Layers of dark roastiness with a really surprising layer of hop presence. This is a real contrast to Blackout Stout which comes across as very clean as Imperial Stouts go. 1

It is so dark and dense that no light permeates the beer.  The nose suggests chocolate nibs coffee vanilla oats and roasted almonds.  The body is medium-full and enveloping.  Quite silky.  Lingers well.  Malty chocolate sweetness moderated by modest hop bitterness.  Nice Belgian lace.  Some heat from the ABV but not distracting.  Quenching. Delicious.  A stout to contemplate while sipping . . .

Black with a nice cream colored head. Amazing coffee and chocolate nose head and lacing are there but didn't last long...temp related fail. Taste and mouthfeel are excellent. One of the best breakfast (oatmeal) stouts I've tried. Recommended. If you're wondering yes this is one you can drink and eat cookies with for breakfast with the GF...lol

The nose is muted malt and hops.  The taste is full flavored coffee with notes of dark chocolate.  Very pronounce flavor and a creamy mouthfeel.  Very good stout heavy on coffee flavor - Sumatra roast comes to mind.  Very tasty nightcap.

I am a huge coffee and chocolate fan so I knew I would love it the first time I tried it. Fort Point Market in Boston has it for 10.99 a 4 pack which is the cheapest I have seen so I love the great value for a world class stout. Excellent sipper that is very enjoyable as it warms.

A: Big chocolate aroma mixed with complex coffee aroma upfront slightly sweet deep chocolate/coffee malt roast touch of alcohol on the finish.   A: Black color totally opaque with a fairly thick khakis colored head.  There is some lacing evident in the glass.  T: Big chocolate and coffee flavor with moderate deep malt that’s slightly sweet with a light bitterness that lingers on the finish.  M: medium bodied with moderate carbonation; the oats provide some smoothness - but not creaminess.  There is also some alcoholic warmth noticeable.  O: Delicious; this beer is annually incredible.  With expanded distribution this beer is still super tasty; Founders please keep it this way.

Big coffee aroma and flavor up front softens a bit as warms.  Mouthfeel pretty good for abv not as hearty as other stouts but at 8% this is very drinkable.  Not many imperial stouts at $3 a bottle.

Smells of chocolate bitter black coffee oats.  Tastes of coffee up front accompanied by the dark chocolate flavor.  Just the right amount of carbonation not flat not bubbly.  Sweet aftertaste. Mocha lacing from where the head once was.  One of the best.

No light makes it through the glass. Barely any head from a gentle pour. Even the slowly-forming edge foam is dark brown. Smell: A roasty smell of dark black coffee or wet coffee grounds bitter frothy chocolate some alcohol presence and charcoal. Taste: Dark roasted coffee hints of bitter chocolate and roasted/charred malts up front. In the middle a sticky oat taste wafts up through the palate. Finishes with a bourbon-like alcohol tease that disappears before it can get sweet followed by an oak barrel effect burnt wood and leather. Mouthfeel: Heavy and smooth. Thick. That first sip slides down the back of the tongue like chocolate milk.  Overall: Wow. Yes.

They don't have what I wanted.  I didn't want to look like looser that didn't have enough cash for a case of PBR so I see this Founders for $9.99 for a four pack.  I figured let's see what all the hype is about.  I am not much of a stout/porter person so I thought I would maybe choking this down over the next few weeks.  I had one yesterday on Christmas.  WOW!  Just great beer.  All that everyone has said is correct.  Outstanding stuff!

Smells like cold brewed coffee and roasted malts. Tastes like coffee - cold coffee bitter and roasty - and dark chocolate roasted malts and not much else. Super smooth mouthfeel with medium carbonation and a dark chocolate bitter finish. A simple imperial stout excellently crafted but lacking something.

Maybe I've had too many Christmas Stouts lately but this reminds me that good Stout doesn't need help to be interesting. It is dark black like strong diner coffee with a generous tan head on the pour (although it settles out quickly). On the nose it is all about coffee but the taste layers in chocolate and vanilla that lingers for at least 25 seconds. The carbonation feels right in the mouth. You will find yourself craving more.

Chocolatey. Malty. Toasty. Dark. Taste: Smooth. Milk chocolatey. Roasty and toasty just like the smell but twice as strong. Coffee presence. Feel: A bit lively in the carbonation but smooth. Thicker mouthfeel thanks to the oatmeal. Creamy. Overall: Pretty good one to let sit out and warm up a bit and bubble off some of that carbonation despite wanting to dive right in.  Simple ingredient set nothing too complex or mindboggling just good. Would absolutely get again.

I looked up the rating on my telephone and bought it.  I don't eat sweets or chocolate so when I saw the bottle saying it is a "double chocolate and coffee" beer I figured I would just keep the case for guests.  So I had one.  In fact his is really good because it is so balanced.  Not too sweet or bitter refreshing.  It is still heavy and has a desertish after-taste but it is for what it is as good as it should be (and maybe could be).

When I introduced my college roommate to this beer he described it as "thick enough to cut with a knife". Chocolate coffee and a creamy finish make this a hearty and filling beer.

Outstanding coffee stout with chocolate notes.  Inky-black in the glass with a cappuccino-hued head this is a truly world-class brew.

Lacing is spotty but lasting. S- Smell is more chocolate than coffee. T- Taste unlike the nose is more balanced between bitter chocolate and coffee. F- Thick smooth and coats the tongue. Carbonation is light which adds to the thick mouthfeel. O- This beer is a very good coffee stout. It's just not my thing being too coffee forward for my liking. One thing I can't deny is that this is very well crafted. If you like coffee you'll like this beer.

Aroma: Fresh espresso loads of cocoa and dark chocolate. Excellent balance with the malt and the coffee/chocolate overall.  Taste: Rich coffee and dark chocolate notes. Slightly smoky and earthy finishes strong with espresso and malt.  Feel: Silky smooth and just thick enough. Leaves a really pleasant mouthfeel and the lingering bitterness from the hops completes the experience really exceptional stuff.  Living in Montgomery County MD it's hard to get this beer. When I went to visit family back home in PA I found a HUGE display of Breakfast Stout at Wegman's and grabbed some. Absolutely lived up to the hype for me phenomenal.

Coffee and roared grain nose. Flavored of coffee and bittersweet dark chocolate; roasted malt; cocoa powder finish. Moderate carbonation; dry cocoa powder mouthfeel. Overall the lite coffee linger has a good roastiness but I thought it drying.

No visible carbonation (but there's no visible anything - opaque!). 1/2 inch tan creamy head with sticky lacing. Toasted coffee and chocolate dominates the aroma. Thick mouth feel little carbonation apparent to the tongue. Mild matly coffee smoky cocoa flavor. Slight bittering in the middle that fades in the sweet coffee & chocolate finish. This is an enjoyable beer but basically a duet between the coffee and the chocolate with the thick body holding them up. A bit too one-dimensional (OK two-dimensional). I'm surprised it is rated so highly by so many

Two totally different beers but I'll be damned if this isn't equally good (if not better)  It's supply is ample in my area but that should not undercut how awesome it is.  Easily one of the best stouts I've ever had... And evidently I like it more and more each time I drink it!

Aroma is bursting with flavor. I get a huge amount of coffee oatmeal and cocoa powder! The coffee is super roasted with an espresso-like concentration.  Taste is surprisingly light for the aroma and appearance. This is not like drinking motor oil which the majority of stouts are leaning towards these days. It is rather crisp with moderate amount of carbonation and an underlying bitterness. The taste is all about the coffee! It's toasty citrusy roasted and almost creamy. Unsweetened chocolate notes as well as some of the oatmeal can be found to round out the sip.   Again I am a little surprised on the rather light feel and citrus notes playing through on this one. It's a very solid stout and drinks very easily. Always worth a taste each year.  I see this pairing well with a coffee-based dessert maybe an affogato. It gets a 90/100.

S: Has a very rich coffee aroma with dark chocolate balancing things out. T: Roasted coffee with dark chocolate predominates the taste a little alcohol at the end to let you know this means business. F: Thick and velvety with enough prickling carbonation to give it a little bite in the back. Which I like. O: Just an outstanding Imperial Coffee Stout one to claim a benchmark for the style. Everything is balanced in harmony but stands out enough to be well noticed. Definitely tastes like some age on it to smooth and meld things together would make it as close to perfect as you can find on this earth.

Mild green pepper aroma. T: Tastes strongly of chocolately coffee moderate sweetness slight creamy taste. Tastes like coffee bitterness is doing some work in lieu of hops. Bitter coffee flavor lingers. F: Feels medium bodied and slightly creamy smooth with slightly astringent mouthfeel.  O: This is a very flavorful beer with loads of coffee and chocolate flavors going on. Being "only" 8.3% you can enjoy these flavors for breakfast without being buzzed all day. It doesn't quite have the "freshly roasted" flavor that some stouts have and others might be hoping for more sweetness. It does the trick though.

Dissipates fairly quickly.  S: Nose is coffee with roasted nuts and dark chocolate.  T: Excellent taste with coffee and subtle flavor of chocolate and maple syrup.   F: Not thick and chewy like some stouts but does have some creaminess to it.  O: Excellent stout one of the better ones I've ever had. Made a point to return for a second one the following night. Delicious with very good balance nothing overwhelms but just the right amount of coffee chocolate and syrupy flavoring!

It's a coffee lover's dream.  The notes of cocoa nib dark chocolate and coffee are pronounced on the nose and the pour produces a thick gorgeous head.  The ABV is high and creates a heavy mouth feel and slight sweetness.  Have this beauty after dinner for dessert on a cold evening.  It will warm you right up.

Smell: Mostly coffee/mocha which is obvious. A soft bit of malt to my nose. Hops even softer.  Taste: Mocha mocha mocha. It's dark chocolate and coffee with the toasted bitterness of a good stout. A creamy sweetness.  Feel: Surprisingly light seductively drinkable. It's smooth with light carbonation and a slight alcoholic bite.  Overall: Wow. Try this stout! They don't hide the 8.30% ABV with the chocolate and the coffee as much as they match it. A perfect example of balance done right even as a double.

Very dark mahogany pour with a completely black opaque body and a thick cloud of light brown head.  I had a fresh bottle recently and the coffee has held up after a year in the cellar.  Cold brew gourmet coffee rich milk chocolate robust roast toasted almond cereal grain with a hint of dark fruits starting to come through.  The mouth feel is perfect thick without the chewiness with a creaminess that coats the mouth and leaves a wonderful bitter roast coffee flavor in the aftertaste.  The flavor has a dessert-like dark chocolate-covered espresso bean quality to it.  Bittersweet cocoa coffee bean dark malts grained oats vanilla  with a smokey char on the back end.  THE beer that opened my eyes to the magic brewers are capable of.  Whether fresh or aged this beer is 'everything a stout ought to be good for'.

Smell of coffee fill the nose along with chocolate and oats.  Taste of coffee and oats and then the bitter cocoa hits. Thick beer but so smooth with every sip. Great stout for any time of the day. And so lucky to have a little place in my town to pick these up at.

Don't get me wrong it is quite good.  It has all of the great stout flavors you want - chocolate nuts coffee.  It's very well balanced and not too sweet.  But I wouldn't say this is the best or most unique stout I have ever had.

Aroma of lightly roasted coffee and baker's chocolate. Nice roasty full flavored coffee some chocolate that is not too overbearing and a nice oatmeal finish. The feel is pretty good but it's a little thin. There is nothing unpleasant about this beer and you could say that everything is pleasant. This is one of my favorite stouts in the world. No nonsense. Terrific.

Its not overwhelming in any area has one of the best coffee/roast scents that I've come across and finishes rather nicely. Plus its one of those stouts that has a wonderful evolution during the course of the beer. It pours out nice and dark with a thicker light brown head to it. The coffee and slight hints of chocolate hit your nose but nothing smells artificial. The taste is of a medium/dark roast coffee and a slight hint of chocolate. There is only a slight hint of bitterness to it which is what makes it my favorite. I would highly recommend this for someone who is looking to get into Stouts for the first time.

Smells of an abundance of roasted coffee and slight dark chocolate. The taste is bittersweet and perfectly balanced coffee with roasty dark chocolate. Feels medium-full smooth and creamy with low carbonation. The chocolate flavors come out more as it warms. Overall an amazing double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout!

2093,/beer/profile/1199/11757/,4.47,look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5,OldManMetal,This imperial stout is brewed with chocolate oats and coffee; it is black as sin and completely impervious to light showing dark chocolate highlights only at the very edges. The thin slightly-pebbly brown head quickly decays to a collar and a haze but it leaves excellent sheets and ladders of the most finely-grained lacing imaginable. On the nose it is very assertive: a whiff of oatmeal up front then a strong luxuriously complex dark chocolate with hints of toffee and more than a hint of alcohol. The palate is slightly sweet dark malt goodness; again the chocolate is the star every bit as nuanced as it is on the nose with toffee playing a supporting role. The finish is boozy toffee followed by a slightly bitter chocolatey roasted flavor that lingers for a few minutes. The big mouthfeel matches the full body and the texture is stickily creamy and very slightly peppery from the relatively soft carbonation. This is how chocolate stout is done.

Look: Black as night. Like a glass of tar or motor oil with a finger head of fluffy off-white foam. Looks like something strong. Smell: Black coffee first and foremost strong like freshly made drip coffee. Hints of chocolate hiding behind that. So much complexity. Smells like it belongs with breakfast. Taste: Bitter dark coffee again at the front with chocolate and roasty flavors behind it even a little maple. Tastes like it would be better off beside a stack of pancakes rather than savory breakfast but still good. Feel: Motor oil thickness but not as much as a Russian Imperial. It's like drinking what happens when you mix cocoa powder into black coffee with some brown sugar added. Overall: Wonderful. Haven't had KBS or CBS but if they're anything like the beer they're based on they'll be just as amazing as this one if not more.

Not sure what else can be said about this one that hasn't been said before. If you don't like this beer then stouts are probably not your thing. Coffee and chocolate dominate and it's not going to have you feel like you downed a few shots of whiskey as the bourbon stouts do. All together it is just a flat out delicious beer

Swirls gracefully and has great retention/lacing.  S) The nose is dominated by coco and chocolate but dark fruit and Belgian candies can be detected as well. The nose has intense roastiness and smells like a gourmet confectioner's counter-top after finishing a batch of dark caramels or toffee.  T) The taste is lovely everything in the nose is on the palate. It isn't as sweet as one would expect based off of the aromas however but that isn't a bad thing considering it would nearly be candy-like based off of the lovely nose.  F) The mouth-feel is not quite as luxurious as the look would make one anticipate however it is still silky and a pleasure to sip on.  O) This beer is worth picking up a 4-pack every year. A great desert beer night-cap beer or ever a breakfast on occasion :^)

It pours dark brown to about black with a modest tan head.  Wicked coffee aroma on the nose. Kind of a burnt malt character too and a moderate orange zing..  Medium to better than medium body.  Wow. This one cleanses the senses with its coffee or more specifically Espresso explosion.  Moderate bitterness to finish.  I rarely drink beer before 12 noon but this one is one that I could drink before then. 
2127,/beer/profile/1199/11757/,4.3,look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25,thebeers,Near black with a finger of mocha-colored head that dissipates quickly but leaves vertical columns of lacing.  Strong aroma of coffee and milk chocolate.  This year's (2015) has a more coffee-forward taste than I remember with big roasted flavors and just a little cream and chocolate in the background as well as a bitter finish that manages to avoid being acerbic.  The flavors meld and the whole thing becomes much more smooth as it warms.  Creamy mouthfeel with just enough carbonation.  Amazing beer.  A classic.

Pours a thick jet back color with a tan colored 1 finger head.  Smells of dark roasted malts chocolate coffee... if only it taste as good as it smells...  ... AND IT DOES. The COFFEE!!! and chocolate roasted malts (and oats to boot!) float around in your mouth while a bit of bitterness from the hops bites the back of your tongue.  This beer is thick in feel and flavor!  Worth a four pack... or a case or two!

Smells malty and strong coffee bean with some chocolate. I'm not a coffee drinker but this tastes like what I imagine a delicious coffee tastes like at Starbucks. Strong on the coffee taste but sweeter elements balance it. mouthfeel is thin but intense leaving bitterness. Smooth carbonation. I get it.

Appearance - black as night and covered with a thick finger of tan head. Retention is good but not great. Some lacing left behind.  Smell - so much coffee! Hints of oatmeal dark chocolate some light smokey aromas but in the end it comes back to coffee. Like freshly used coffee grains right after making a pot of it. Nose is so aromatic I can almost taste coffee before my first sip. Spectacular.  Taste - again the coffee shows up in ridiculous force but it is accompanied by a little bit of chocolate and oat like flavor. The bitterness is strong but not overwhelming just right in its delivery.  Mouthfeel - so smooth and incredibly creamy silky like velvet rolling down your throat. Body is thick but not overwhelmingly so and finish is succulent. Great feel.  Overall - Ok so I admit I was curious about all the hype for Founders Breakfast Stout. It's not accessible in Ontario and usually beers with this much hype do deliver but for some reason I just wasn't sure. So glad I picked up a 4 pack and may need to come back and pick up another back for a "breakfast for dinner" themed party coming up soon. Just an awesome beer and the coffee explosion is real with this one.  Edit -  April 2 2017. I don't often go across the border to venture in the States. But when I do I damn well make sure to get a 4 pack of this because well life is better with coffee stouts that have this much flavor and deliciousness this much intensity yet every sip leaves you wanting to drink more and more and... well "beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy" quote that is attributed (rightly or wrongly to Ben Franklin) certainly applies here. I can't think of a reason to be unhappy while sipping on one of these glorious coffee stouts. Just try it; unless you hate coffee you won't be let down. And as a a final reminder; there's a reason why as of this writing more than 16000 enthusiasts have endorsed this beer as as one of the best in the world more than any other on this site. Surely 16000 individuals who love and care about beer couldn't be wrong about this one could they? 2

Look: Pitch black like used motor oil allowing no light to pass through. Non aggressive pour yielded small dark tan head that dissipated fairly quickly leaving thick lacing of the same color that remained throughout.   Smell: Strong roast coffee dark bitter chocolate and toasted oats. Very strong smelling but not overpowering.  Feel: Rich and creamy all the way balanced by carbonation.  Taste: Bitter coffee and toasty flavor accompanied by hints of dark chocolate. Back end tastes strongly of rich coffee. As it warms up the alcohol taste is noticeable but blends well with the rich flavors; the burn is very minor.  Overall: I have heard a lot of great things about this beer so I picked up a 4-pack to try. I was not disappointed. Great tasting not overpowering and a rich and creamy feel makes it live up to its reputation of being great. However the batch I got was very fresh and I have heard that its a little better aged a few months. After trying some aged I will update the review accordingly. 1

The aroma is loaded with dark chocolate a hint of coffee and vanilla and some char. On my tongue the chocolate flavors lead the way deep and dark followed by a rather sweet middle and a slightly acidic roast coffee finish. A nice lingering bitter with a bit of nuttiness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium-thick and fairly smooth. Outstanding.

The smell is like super-coffee -- strong but also sophisticated. Couldn't really detect the chocolate or any oatiness but they add dimension and richness. Still it's that slightly-smokey coffee that dominates making it not only an easy "breakfast"/morning celebration but ironically smells and tastes like it'd be at home at an evening dinner/table party.  If I'm going to nitpick the feel is maybe not as heavy or creamy as I would like or expect -- slight wateriness keeps it from being perfect though not detracting. One could also ask for more distinct presence in the attending flavors being a "Breakfast" stout but I'd hate to mess with this coffee showcase. ABV hits quick too! and harder than its ~8% suggests. Absolutely in my cellar of fame beers.

The smell is divine with the coffee giving a powerful punch. Some chocolate and roasty notes as well. The taste has so much chocolate and coffee this beer is the perfect closer. A slight smokiness hit you on the after taste. Very smooth medium mouthfeel and low-medium carbonation. A beer I've loved for a long time and tried to give it the least biased review I could.

Nice roasted bitterness comes through. No alcohol taste whatsoever.  M: Wonderful medium to heavy body  O: One of the best balanced stouts I've enjoyed. The roasted coffee with bread notes is wonderful and the morning flavors are true to its name. Love to enjoy at the end of a night out or when drinking with deserts. Definitely a go to stout.

This screams Morning Beers like no other.  Black pour with a solid tan head.  Nose is dominated by coffee chocolate oats booze.  Tastes like hungover Thanksgiving morning breakfast - boozy maple syrup coffee chocolate oatmeal.  Cannot say enough about this beer.  Can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning and this is one to start with!

Poured into a tulip with a nice ~2 inch head pitch black brew and a dark tan head like the crema on an espresso that leaves a ring around the liquid.  Smells of dark roasted coffee malt baker's chocolate with coffee ruling them all.  As to be expected of an imperial stout it's got a big body and sticky mouth feel but not too big and not too sticky.  The finish sticks in your mouth just long enough to remind you why you want another sip.  There's a brief sharpness on the tongue near the finish that might just be hop but it's hard to say.  Whatever that is it keeps this stout from becoming sickeningly sticky and the immense coffee prevents it from getting too sweet.  Great brew that deserves at least some of the hype surrounding it.  Wish I had a constant supply.

Great head retention with a lot of lacing present.  S - Smells like the bottle preaches. Coffee chocolate and even a mild note of oatmeal. Of the three I feel coffee is the most prominent aroma.  T - To start I'm not a huge coffee fan though I am a huge stout fan. I was expecting an overwhelming taste of chocolate yet was surprised that coffee was the dominant flavoring; yet in a good way. The coffee flavoring is well subdued by the chocolate though. The stout lives up to its name and overall I'm very pleased!  M - Full bodied thick and creamy beer. Fairly bitter feel due to the coffee bean. Alcohol is present but very very mild. Very pleasant.   O - The beer lives up to its hype! I've been awaiting to enjoy this beer and Founders didn't let me down. The only thing I'd change about the beer -- next time I'll have it with a plate of bacon...and eggs...

Smells of coffee notes with underlying hints of roasted oats and sweetness. Thick mouthfeel coating the entire mouth. Tastes of lightly roasted coffee with a touch of sweetness. Taste is lighter than the feel little bit airy. Finishes on a nice roasted bitterness.

The coffee dominates the smell.  Taste: Chocolate comes through at first and then the bitter coffee comes through at the end.  Some roastiness from the coffee and sweetness from the chocolate.  Feel: Thick bodied very little alcohol bite.  Overall: One of my favorite stouts I look forward to every year.  This is a must-try beer for any person that loves beer.

One a relatively gentle pour the other incredibly violent bringing more head than beer in the glass.  Color is dark dark ruby red near black but obviously red against the light.  Grey head forms on violent pour it retains well.  Nose is almost all chocolate.  Dark roast malt is huge and coffee is there too.  Flavor is dominated by coffee with chocolate less present than expected.  With a gentle pour it is definitely on the bitter side - sweetness isn't pronounced unless a heavy pour takes away a good bit of the carbonation.  A bit more sweetness comes as it warms but it's definitely not a "sweet" stout.  Very nice overall.

Smell is chocolate coffee maybe some kind of tart fruit?  Taste is smooth coffee and bitter dark chocolate.  Very faintly sweet and bitter with mostly the coffee shining through.  Feels like thick rich liquid.  I'm more of a hop head when it comes to beer but I can fully appreciate the value in this delicious and readily-available stout.

Has a heavy coffee smell with notes of chocolate.   As with the smell the roasted coffee and chocolate dominate. I don't recall ever having such a coffee/chocolate-intensive beer except perhaps Surly's Coffee Bender. There is also a stint of sweetness which is much appreciated. I suppose I was expecting a more complex flavor but for what it is the Breakfast Stout is excellent. Paid $12 for a four-pack.

The taste does here follow the nose and the beer is very nicely poised between bitter and sweet which is how I like my chocolate and my coffee. And my beer for that matter. A deserved classic.

Tastes like black coffee bitter chocolate very rich tasting.  Although I'm not a regular coffee drinker I do appreciate the rich flavor of this stout as I like stouts in general.

Pours a bottom-of-the-ocean black with a thin nutmeg-colored head with minimal carbonation. Aroma of coffee chocolate toffee roasted oats and wood. Taste follows suit with a pronounced coffee bitterness mellowed by the chocolate sweetness...which is just fantastic. The alcohol is there both as a source of warmth and a light kick in the waning moments of the sip. World class beer that always comes to mind whenever I try a new (or highly touted) stout and I'm left looking for just a little more...can't help but compare all comers to this gem.

Taste is extremely well balanced with chocolate coffee and a slight amount of hops and malts. Has a thick mouthfeel but a little too carbonated for a feel that thick.  One of the better (regularly available) stouts around.

S:  lovely coffee smells.  Bit of chocolate.  T:  bit of bitterness from coffee (and maybe hops?).  Dark chocolate semisweet malts.  Cant taste oats too much here.  Was expecting a lot richer flavor profile based on reviews here.  F:  actually a bit thin IMO.  For coffee stouts anyway.  O:  liked it.  Not sure if this will be regular purchase for me though.  It doesn't top our other coffee stout shelf options such as Speedway and Peche Mortel.  Still good though.

Pitch black with a uniform tan head that that leaves some lace on the glass.  S: 4.5 Aromas on this beer is very nice. Lots of bittersweet chocolate dark roasted coffee vanilla brownies liquorish chicory and earthy grainy malt. The coffee smells mostly of French roast but there is a slight berry element that works its way in.  T: 4 Taste is pretty similar to the nose. However roast dominates a bit more on the palate. The roast is balanced out nicely by mild sweetness but comes back with fairly strong lingering bitterness on the finish.   M: 4.25 Carbonation is spot on. I almost feel like the body could be a bit more substantial but the beer’s relatively light feel makes this beer super drinkable.  O: 4.25 FBS is a really nice coffee stout. The chocolate elements help balance things out very well – much better in my opinion than the vanilla in victory at sea. Maybe not the best coffee stout but very drinkable and tasty. 1

It smells of coffee chocolate and a roasted scent.  The beer smell the same as it tastes and is as rich as it looks.  It has a full body taste the first sip was what you expect from a stout.  I'm not much of a coffee drinker but still loved this beer.

Breakfast in a glass  Taste - Follows the nose with tons upon tons of coffee espresso dark chocolate cocoa roasted malts Feel - good mouthfeel for a coffee stout medium plus I'd say. 8.3% is well hidden   Overall - This is a coffee fanatics dream beer. Very enjoyable coffee aroma and flavor. Do I agree w/ the 99 overall score....probably not but this is still a great shelf stout.

There is nice tan lacing that sticks around.  The smell is dark chocolate and strong dark coffee with a slight subtle bitterness. The taste focuses on the coffee but without tasting burnt or bitter.  The chocolate comes through nicely and blends perfectly with the coffee.  There is no hint of the alcohol.  The mouthfeel is incredible.  The oatmeal makes for a thick smooth feel with great velvety carbonation.  Overall this an amazing beer.  With about 8-12 months this beer turns into something better than amazing.  All the flavors meld and the coffee backs off a bit bringing out the great chocolate flavor.  Just outstanding.

Little lacing to speak of. I wish I had poured it a little faster to get a longer-retaining head.   S -- Coffee roasted malts chocolate. Straightforward but very powerful.   T -- Coffee and chocolate are the major players as to be expected. They push and pull at each other alternating who leads sometimes dancing together in mocha unison. The chocolate is sometimes quite bitter other times smooth and embraces the tongue.   F -- Luscious and decadent. Full bodied light carbonation. The alcohol provides a warmth that is welcomed and pleasant. Chewy velvety I mean damn just pick a word. The feel is absurd and exactly what I'd want from a stout.   O -- I understand why this one is rated so highly. It's a very well developed stout that hits many of the spots I want from one. Also very impressive that Founders puts out a beer this good for national distribution. In a world where everyone is trying to one-up each other (in general not just in beer) it's always easy to appreciate when someone does something "simple" but does it incredibly well. 1

It's average. I first drank it cold and allowed it to warm. I waited for the coffee and chocolate to blossom. It reminded me more of a bakers chocolate with some coffee added but not good coffee! And I LOVE coffee. Southern Tier Mokah and Choklat are much better chocolate coffee stouts. So I kept drinking this and a week later with a bag of fresh popcorn I take most of it back! The salt on my pallet brought out the flavors! I change my mind! It's good!  Lol

S: Very nice aroma. Strong coffee upfront and a general roastiness throughout.  Some hop aroma and dark malt notes but certainly not sweet.  T: Roastiness—with some discernible coffee—and strong bitterness upfront.  Substantial burnt taste with *dark* chocolate notes.  Substantial lingering bitterness.  F: This beer’s got a full chewy luscious mouthfeel.  Just above a low level of carbonation.  Slight warmth but not much. Delightful.  O: One of my all-time favorite imperial stouts. It’s got a very nice aroma and a heavenly mouthfeel all at a relatively moderate abv making it very drinkable for the style. Perhaps a tad overrated and a little bit of age in the fridge helps mellow out some of the bitterness. Also FBS boasts one of my favorite beer labels!

A wonderfully executed coffee forward stout. I love coffee imperial stouts but often they're too heavy on the coffee. This one nailed it with a perfect balance of flavors. Lived up to the hype.  Wish I could get this regularly in California.

The appearance was solid black (as expected with a stout) with a mocha-colored head; the smell/taste was of rich coffee mixed with chocolate... almost like chocolate-covered espresso beans; the feel was creamy and smooth with a thick body. Overall Founders definitely killed it with this one! Just an amazing beer cheers!

Smell of freshly roasted coffee beans some cocoa powder earth lots of roasted malt and some sweet malt. Taste is fantastic coffee chocolate roasted malt vanilla and almost a milky cream flavor.

I find it to be slightly more bitter on the front but easing into the wonderful coffee and chocolate found in its bigger better brother. It's an enjoyable stout. I look forward to aging a few bottles and see how they stand up over time.

Coffee and chocolate on the nose that carry though on the palate.  In terms of imperial stouts this one leans more heavily into a consistent flavor profile  of chocolate and coffee and avoids the variance/complexity of those that add more dark fruit and bitterness.  That is a stylistic point rather than a critique - the coffee and chocolate domain that this beer squarely annexes is excellent.

Pours a beautiful black stout color with slight tan head which soon disappears. Aroma is strong mix of chocolate and coffee.  Sweet taste but not as sweet as Angry Chair Brewing Fudge Bucket. Alcohol presence is noticeable but not overpowering but enough to rub against the tongue. Minimal aftertaste. Really nice.

Sadly I am drinking this one in the shadow of KBS and CBS which were both awesomer versions of the same thing albeit a hell of a lot harder to come by so this one gets extra points for availability. Pours black as mud and tastes like it means business as it should.  Picture a hot coffee and toast breakfast with some fancy chocolate-covered raisins or something for dessert on a winter day and this is what that would taste like in beer form...really boozy beer.  Lacking the overwhelming sweetness of CBS and that addicting gritty texture and oaky taste of KBS but featuring the boozy strength and basic flavor profiles of both this is a fantastic mid-range stout.   Easily delicious enough to be worth spending a few bucks more on a 4-pack compared to a sixer of something less amazing.  Seriously if it weren't for my insatiable quest to drink every beer I can this would be one of my go-to regular buys.  Total desert island beer except that it would probably kill me by the end of the 3rd day on that island. Only complaint is that I think a heavier carbonation and thick head would go quite nicely with this one - it's virtually fizzless. 1

I don't know but I wanted one. Yes this is stout. Aroma bitter coffee and chocolate 2014 keg but very fresh and pungent. Taste follows coffee chocolate very bitter. Thin but appropriate for the abv level. Smooth finish.  My only complaint is the last 8 oz of 32 gets very palate weary and frankly a bit annoying. Still a great beer but I generally prefer just one 12 oz bottle. And I definitely prefer fresh Wake n Bake which I'll drink all winter and into early spring. But sometimes you just gotta have a Breakfast Stout. Now that thinking about it I want another. Oh well it will be available soon.

I love a good coffee stout and this is one of the best non-aged regular releases out there but it has a lot more to offer than just the coffee. I find that waiting another month or two helps to bring some of the other flavors more to the fore. By comparison some other coffee stouts that are very heavy on the coffee such as Big Bad Baptist really shine when fresh but don't gain as much over time.

Aroma has coffee and chocolate hints the taste follows the nose with subtle coffee and chocolate flavors. A medium bodied silky smooth well balanced complex beer.

S: Wonderful malty coffee chocolate roast aroma.  T: Nice round wave of flavors. You get the creaminess that the oatmeal provides the chocolate and roast flavors the great malty body (great body). Its just layers of flavor after flavor like a wonderful desert.  F: full bodied and moderate carbonation.  O: Great finishing beer. Wouldn't want to drink it all day but would drink it most of the night.

Taste - I'm really struck by the aftertaste. The oatmeal and bitter chocolate really grow after a few seconds. As Borat would say "very nice"  Feel - Medium. Not too heavy.  Overall - A very unique stout.  Great flavor and aftertaste.  Not too heavy.  My only knock is the smell doesn't prepare you for the excited your mouth will soon have.

If you think that barrel aged stouts are too much (like me) but oatmeal stout aren't enough (not me) this is the beer for you. A perfect balance of flavor regardless of high alcohol content. No syrupy flavor it maintains the same bite as any 5% alcohol stout. That burnt grain taste is so tasty that you just can't stop drinking it. There is not that straight alcohol flavor that you would expect of any beer over 8%. It's perfectly balanced and absolutely brilliant.

Quite earthy roasted nose to it which is nice to actually smell a stout. Great taste. Oats and malt are very present. Coffe like coco sediment delivers the tastebuds a nice aftertaste. Carbonation not as present as expected but this is an old bottle so maybe thats why. Complements food well with a clean wash but the alcohol is somewhat obvious. Which isnt always bad I guess. Well done. Woukd buy again. Well balanced.

Opaque. Very Viscous.  Smell- Roasted dark chocolate. Roasted coffee beans.  Taste- Freshly roasted coffee first hits the palate retaining coffee like bitterness early on in the flavor profile. Next comes a layer of dark chocolate with a roasted/smoked quality as well. Finishes sweet with a molasses/syrup flavor carrying along some residual bitterness from the coffee and chocolate undertones.  Mouthfeel- Heavy in body low carbonation but fresh to the palate. Thick.  Overall- A fine stout. A bit lacking in the chocolate flavor considering it says "double chocolate" on the label. This is more of a coffee forward stout. Good after dinner sipping beer....not so sure about breakfast.

According to the label it was bottled on October 27 2014.  Poured into a Jones Radiator nonic pint glass the pour was a viscous dark brown and gave up nothing when held up to direct light. Big creamy mocha-colored head that took it’s time dropping. There was a beer-neglige style band of thin foam around the top of the glass with spotty and streaky lace scattered about pell-mell.  There was dark roast coffee mollasses and chocolate in the nose in that order.  Coffee chocolate and molasses combine for a deep velvety smooth embrace of the taste buds. While there is bitterness (60 IBUs worth per the neck label) it’s more of a coffee bitterness with hoppy bitterness seemingly way out on the periphery.  Full bodied with a creamy coating velvety mouthfeel.  This is a decadent beer. If available in my neck of the woods this would be a regular part of the cold weather lineup and a nice dessert beer just about any time. A long-time want that did not fail to deliver. 1

Nice lacing.  S:  Resinous pine caramel malts.  Aromatic with some floral notes.  T/F:  Big malt backbone... sweet caramel and toasted grains.  Bitterness follows... evergreen/pine light fruit and floral tones.  Complex... slightly earthy. Balanced... light citrus comes through at the finish.  Medium to light bodied.  O:  A fantastic DIPA that I've had many many times.  Even as I've gotten more into the New England juice bombs this one never fails to please.  A beer that was ahead of its time and still great today.

Smell was aromatic with a bright and complex hop profile. I personally loved the taste and the feel complimented the body well. Nice malty tone that helped keep the high gravity manageable on the palate. Another great beer from Dogfish.

Beer was just recently introduced to me by a family friend. Not only did he tell me it would change my life but it would affect how I did things from here on out. It did change my life and it started with the 90 minute IPA by Dogfish Head. I was working at a winery at the time but it was so snowy outside (oregon terms) because of this work was cancelled. I was still able to drive around with four-wheel drive so I listen to my peers and seeked out a location where I could get my hands on this elusive beer. I purchased a four pack and brought it back to Monmouth. The ensuing hours later provided plenty of entertainment and joy. At this moment when I first put my lips to a 90-minute bottle I knew what love was. From that moment forward I will never forget the night I fell in love with the pure lifestyle of Craft Brew in general.

Now I don't typically go for a hoppy beer particularly one that is hopped like a rabbit on meth. My go to beers are the ones you can't see through but this came highly recommended by someone whose beer knowledge and opinions I trust implicitly.   Interestingly rather than having a sharp aggressive hoppiness the DFH 90-Minute IPA is very balanced. Strong beery smell and taste but the flavor had an amazing citrus zestiness that stays on your tongue. Nice head deep gold color good amount of carbonation and at 9% ABV I feel a bit woozy. And relaxed.

Getting into the  IPA/APA's makes a Bud Light Lime that I had recently taste absolutely horrible! LOL ....I had a Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA the other day (The first time I've tried any Dogfish Head product) It was excellent!  ...After 6 hours at a steady 34 degrees I just had a 90-min.  It went down quickly feeling it big time! and ready for the next one!   My overall rating is definitely higher than 4.01    :)

Take everything about the 60 minute version and multiply it by 1.5 (get it?). Taste smell and feel in much fuller and front forward with each sip. If enjoying a 60 minute is like getting your bachelor's degree enjoying this one is like getting your masters (I'm sure you know which dogfish gets you your PHD!!).

Juicy grapefruity hops aromas fill the nose. Rich west-coast hops combined with a sturdy malt backbone juicy citrus and caramel all in a velvety smooth medium-full bodied liquid that hides its higher alcohol content very well. Wonderful! Probably the best IIPA I've ever tasted and certainly my favorite.

Bottling date is 10/(smudged)/17 so maybe 3 months old at most -- this one has been kept in refrigeration (bought at a grocery store kept in fridge after) so I know it should be pretty fresh.  This is a really nice looking beer -- foam is a thin layer upon first pouring but then expands and slooowly starts to shrink back away in a fluffy cloud-like uneven way the color is a nice dark orange mostly clear (a bit of a haze is visible with the aid of a flashlight but it's not like witbier/hefeweizen... or orange juice) with loads of tiny bubbles rising up in two curved streams.  Smell is somewhat mild at first but pleasant.  Fruity and piney/almost cedar-like hoppy smells are the most noticeable thing here.  There's also a richer caramel-type malt in the background compared to other IPAs I've had.  After a few sips when the foam has shrunk away just a bit those piney hops come out in full force becoming by far the most noticeable smell of the beer.  Interestingly toward the very end of the glass this flips around again and an almost toasted-sourdough-bread sort of thing starts to come through the wall of hop aromas.  Always interesting to see a beer with flavors or smells that shift as you drink it especially when it continues to be pleasant the whole way through.  Taste is different than a lot of other IPAs -- rather than being all hops with little to no malt the malt seems to almost be the primary flavor but with piney slightly fruity and bitter hops layered over it.  The malt is rich just like in the smell has a bit of a caramel-esque quality to it but not quite -- slightly sweet but balanced out by the bitterness of all the hops so the beer overall never really "feels" sweet.  Getting a slightly unpleasant thing here and there that I'm not sure how to describe (maybe a wet fabric/hair sort of deal?) but it's only there for a moment and not on every sip.  My glass may be to blame for that one as I don't recall tasting this "off" flavor in the bottle I had before the current four-pack (a much older bottle almost gave a "lite barleywine" impression more than IPA but still pretty good) which I drank from a different glass when visiting family a while back.  Since I only noticed that thing once or twice each time and only in this glass I'm blaming the glass and not letting it affect my score of the beer itself.  Burps are nice piney hop flavor all the way.  At first I wasn't super impressed but this is really growing on me the more I drink.  Feel is light and crisp at first then more substantial-feeling.  A little odd to transition from one extreme to the other like that but it works!  There's a hop-oily lingering feeling in the mouth for a while after a sip or two and the bitterness while never seeming at all harsh or overwhelming somehow seems to go all the way down the back of your throat as you swallow a sip of the beer rather than only being felt/tasted on the tongue.  Seems heavier than a lot of IPAs which I suppose makes sense considering that it's 9% ABV and this was (if I recall my beer history correctly) one of the "OG" double IPAs back before "double IPA" was even really a defined thing.  So here's a confession -- I glanced at the average score and went into this review (based on my impressions of the previous bottle) thinking that there was no way I'd give this beer a 4.2ish average maybe a high 3-somethings or an even 4 at best.  And then as I actually drank the beer and put my thoughts down and converted them into numbers... I found myself enjoying it more and more from one sip to the next.  This is a beer that grows on you for sure -- if you tried it just once and weren't a fan (or even thought it was "good but not great") I would recommend you give it another chance.    This was definitely a lesson in why my policy of always trying a beer twice before putting your thoughts down in a review is a good idea -- some beers just get better the second or third or fourth time you drink them.  If you're a fan of hop/malt balance with both ingredients being obvious contributors but neither quite overpowering the other try a fresh bottle (or four) of this beer. 4

Immediately I picked up the thickness and coffee like notes you might find in a stout. The mouthfeel is full creamy and bubbly. If you like hoppy creamy beers this one is for you. I prefer my IPAs to be a little more light and fruity so this isn't exactly my favorite but it's still a great beer.

The sweetness is justified though it makes for a quite well rounded beer that I enjoyed thoroughly.

The pour is viscous oily almost and the head is slow to form. The color is copper and the small head is light tan.  The aroma is rich and overall sweet with melon orange light resin and cotton candy covering down on the hops.   Very sweet and malty. Distinct flavors of caramel pudding orange marmalade and cotton candy.   This beer is medium bodied slick and has enough carbonation to stand up to the sweetness and viscosity.   At just over a month old this isn't the hop bomb of reputation. Based on this OG east coast IPA I can see where the reputation they have for being malty comes from. It carries the alcohol well has some good hop flavor and the sweetness and bitterness are subtly balanced.

A: pours a hazy dark copper with 1 finger of thick off-white head and a few lazy bubbles here and there. Thick cap retains well. Moderate lacing.  S: super resiny sweet candied citrus and a touch of pineapple. Navel oranges. A little boozy and syrupy on the nose. Behind the feel the smell of this beer is perfect DIPA.  T: bitter boozy arrival. Alcohol and hops. Malt across the middle stops just short of sweet. Lingering sweet but slightly unripe orange citrusy bitterness.  M: heavier end of midweight moderately high carbonation. Surprisingly clean. Actually the mouthfeel may be the strongest part of this beer.  O: reminds me of sixpoint resin. Full hoppy citrusy sweet aroma and a malty but not sweet and powerful palate. Alcohol is slightly present and the hop assault is in full effect but this one is a real winner.

But it left an impression. A good one. I enjoyed it so. For the money you pay you are defintely getting a quality beer. No two ways about that. Has good flavor color and "horsepower" for what it is as I call it.

Slight tinge of orange colour to this beer that I was not expecting (although there is no reason why it shouldn't have some orange in it). Nice citrus particularly orange comes through on the nose. Malt (caramel) sweetness also evident. Massive malt sweetness and orange comes up front on tasting. As the label suggests the malt puts the hops in its place so to speak making the hops seems rather subdued. Overall I find the malt bill to be cloying and overpowering. I can taste more alcohol than hops. An IPA? Where's the beef?

Decent head mild lacing not as pillowy as a Bells Two Hearted.  Golden yellow in color regular IPA aroma.  But the taste is so smooth.  This is one of the best IPAs on earth.   Good thing it comes in 4 packs cause it packs a kick.  Nice job DogFish Head!

Pours a deep amber with a sticky white head. Aroma is of slightly fruity hops very pleasant smell. Taste very well balanced between the floral/fruity hops and a little biscuity malt. Not much citrus. Goes down smooth. Very enjoyable. Prost!

Tastes like a well balanced "east coast" or English imperial IPA. High quality caramel malt backbone. Somewhat floral. Mild hoppiness compared to West coast hop bombs. ( Which I also  enjoy very much) Mild fresh baked bread flowers. Feels smooth and quaffable for a 9% ABV. Not too slick Not too dry. Delicious example. Again Kudos to DFH !!  A little more hop bite to offset the malts and I think you would be solid 5.That is my opinion. But then again if it isn't broken don't fix it.Great brew! REVISED 11/22/17: After many months of drinking 90 minute I must say there is too much malt for my taste in a IPA either west or east coast style.

This is a clean easy to drink DIPA and zero bite at 9% ABV. Outstanding beer.

A kick in the head but enjoyable with a pleasant barley head which paves way for the bevery of mountainside hopes which are very much incoming. A bit of nutmeg? Some berry? And it makes ya feel good.

Rich smooth taste not bitter.  Dogfish Head taste test: 60 Minute IPA vs 90 Minute IPA The 90 Minute is slightly darker and has a creamier foamier head. The 60 minute is milder the 90 minute sharper. 60 minute = 6% alc. 90 minute = 9% alc. By the time you finish them both the taste test really doesn't matter so much.  90 Minute IPA is my favorite IPA so far.

This gives a 2 finger aromatic head that lasts. The color is a cloudy dark straw. There is slight aroma from malt and hops. There is a really nice balance of taste from malt and hops which is more citrusy than Sierra Nevada. Bitterness is fully balanced throughout the palate with a hint of malt which offers a smooth finish. Very little bitter aftertaste. perfectly balanced flavor!  Definitely not as bitter as Sierra Nevada 40 IBU or Torpedo 65 IBU.  I really could not tell much difference between the 60 minute and the 90 minute IPA except for the alcohol aftereffects which were greater with the 90 minute.  Wow more like a wine!!!

I had heard great things but I had trouble believing it. A must try.  Taste Rating in Words: When you wake up go outside and the sun is out there is a slight breeze it's not to hot and you can just sit there all day enjoying the beauty.

I was headlong into west-coast IPAs and the maltiness of this beer turned me off. I was foolish.  This is a much finer beer than I remember because for one thing I've learned to appreciate more malty notes; but mostly it's because Dogfish Head is a great brewery.  I would say the flavor is more like a (very) hoppy barleywine. Which with my current palate suits me just fine. Piney hops provide a lingering dryness but the real attraction here is the caramel dark fruit that hits yet doesn't overstay its welcome like a lot of Belgium quads.  Highly highly recommended.

Slight haze.  Hits the nose with piney citrus hops and sweet malts.  The flavor is a terrific balance of mildly bitter hops and big bold malts for amazing balance.  Chewy.  Almost rich on the palate.  Dark fruit.  Full bodied with perfect carbonation.  Surprising mild when compared to other IPA's.   Quite unique.  Fantastic how the complete blend comes on with a porter aspect.  Great IPA.  Simply a great beer.  One of the best.  This will always find a spot in my beer refrigerator.

Great balance of malt with the declared intensity of hop additions. This brew is in no way bitter and still impressively not overly sweet. Right out of the fridge into a belgian tulip glass the brew tastes a bit coppery and lacks  its potential depth. Let it heat up closer to 60*F for that real experience of caramel malty and hoppy goodness.

Pours a slightly hazy dark orange with a 1/2 in. oily tan head.  Leaves nice layered lace in the glass.  Smells as malty as it does hoppy.  Tastes sweet malty mildly hoppy and goes down very smooth for a IIPA.  It actually tastes like an "older" style IIPA might which I guess is appropriate given its heritage.  I'm a fan and I'm glad I have three more!

The taste is very bitter but this is how I love my beers.  Mouthfeel is thick and oily.    = I dig this DIPA.  Great taste with loads of hops.  You can never go wrong. 
313,/beer/profile/64/2093/,4.4,look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5,Harrison8,Pours a frosted amber-orange with two fingers of dense off-white foam. Head retention is fantastic with great lacing left behind. Aroma is earthy and biscuity malts with floral hops. Not overly loud but it is a dense earthy aroma. Flavor profile puts floral herbal hops on the tongue immediately with a herbal hop finish. Earthy biscuit malts swell up in the middle before stepping out of the way of the hop finish. Mouth feel is thick with a huge velvety texture. It's quite filling. Overall this beer is 9% and definitely carries the presence of a 9% beer. While not extremely high it is in dangerous territory. The thick feel and dense flavor profile really level this one off as a pleasant sipper. Very enjoyable beer without an over-done bitterness.  Served in a 12oz snifter from bottle.

Nice lacing down the glass. Smell is subdued but hoppy and slightly fruity. Tastes quite bitter with hints of grapefruit and a bit of booziness comes through. However the malt balanced it out pretty well and it's a good sipping beer. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy lightly carbonated and finishes dry. Overall a very nice IPA I'm glad I can finally get this in Minnesota. Bottle was almost two months old so ill be looking for a fresh one wherever I can.

Deep amber color.  S-Subdued aroma. But as I continue to inhale I get the smell of aging fruits like grapefruit and other tropical fruits. Strong hops as well. T- Wonderfully flavored. Bitter and sweet from the hops yet it is also smooth. Notes of citrus especially grapefruit. Very malty. Strong taste. I also get a warmth through my body when drinking this brew. Don't know if its just me but I enjoyed it F- Creamy and smooth mouth feel.  O- Best Imperial Ipa Ive ever had. Very finely crafted. Great on every mark. Well done Dogfish.

It's imbued with that "hot caramel thickness" often found in high ABV beers. This is perfectly complimented by pine citrus and other features inherent to east coast IPA's.  Fantastic albeit a little short on IBU's to cover up the ABV burn

The look is a lovely Amber-orange a very nice foamy head not quite off white and rich looking The smell is a bit subdued but you still get all the notes of grapefruit some other tropical fruits and a slight sweetness from  the malt. The taste is almost exactly like the nose the hops are also subdued initially but as the beer warms up you can get more of the hop-bitterness on the back end backed up by that lovely malt backbone. The mouthfeel is what I call a rich lightness bordering on medium. Very smooth all the way through a highly drinkable DIPA. Overall what I get from this  beer is that its a subdued version of Stone's Enjoy By which ain't such a bad thing. Since this is more readily available in my area it probably would be my go to DIPA (Until I try more of Lagunitas' stuff that is). It's definitely an enjoyable outstanding beer. 1

Strong hops and malt profile provide a bitter profile to match some of the sweeter sugars in the beer. It's a man's beer and is a great choice to have.

Aroma is grapefruit pineapple pine and caramel. The flavor is a very nice mixture of bitter and sweet. The feel of this beer is it's only weak point in my opinion as I feel it needs a touch more carbonation. Overall a fantastic beer that I'm glad has finally found it's way into Minnesota.

378,/beer/profile/64/2093/,4.48,look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5,PlinyMeNow,A fantastic DIPA with great hoppy bitterness and plenty of bready malty sweetness to balance it out. Flavor is complex but not busy and the layers are worth exploring as you sip. Subtle alcohol warmth does come in but does not detract. Feels smooth and resiny mouth-coating. Everything you want in a DIPA if you appreciate balance rather than extreme bitterness.

The smell is fairly decent but not among the better qualities of this extremely good beer.  It's somewhat like hay.  The taste is exceptional.  I'm not generally a fan of IPAs but this is top notch.  There is a good deal of complexity; which is to say a nice mix of pine malty sweetness and perhaps a hint of "pale ale" instead of IPA in there.  The aftertaste has a nice "bite" to it but the flavor to me wasn't quite as good as the earlier part of a drink.  Overall a solid 4.75 .  Great beer but I'm not going to inflate the score to perfect just based on reputation.  The minor factors bringing it down just a shade for me were the aftertaste and that if you keep it in your mouth a little too long it's not quite as pleasant.

Mild complex aroma subtle malts an sweetness mixed with the hoppy bite.  Starts sweet with malts then the hops take the next beat with a bitter kick that's well balanced.  Flavor is complex and worth savoring the feel evolves as you sip and plays like a symphony. Overall worth your time if you appreciate a fine craft IPA.

The head of this brew is about two fingers thick. There is also a decent amount lacing to this IPA it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell of 90 Minute IPA is rich with sweetness earthly grains and malts. There is a mildness of hops in the smell of this brew. The look and smell are really inviting. Now for the taste it is bold with flavors. You first pick up on the hop bitterness then the earthy grains and malts. There is also a nice amount of sweetness in the taste of this brew.  It is really hard to pick up on the 9.00% AVB in this brew. It goes down that smooth. This is a nice medium to heavy bodied brew. You can feel that this IPA is  heavier than most on the market not saying that is a bad thing. The mouth feel is Bold Hoppy Sweet Clean and Refreshing. Overall I'm giving 90 Minute IPA a 4.50 out of 5. I would definitely buy this brew again. Dogfish Head Craft Brewery did a super nice job with this American Double/ Imperial IPA. If you are looking for a boder IPA look this one up. 1

Poured from the bottle into a snifter this beer's head is two fingers thick and off-white with solid lacing and a clear deep oakish brown body.              Smells like honey biscuit/cracker malts with oilyresinous hops of the pine/grapefruit variety.             I taste big malts defending the palate throne from massive hop notes.            Medium mouthfeel with mild carbonation.           I'll rate 90 Minute IPA | Dogfish Head Craft Brewery with a 4.5

Smell is tropical fruits pine and sweet malts.  Taste is tropical fruits citrus pine and sweet malts that balance out the hop presence. Medium bodied lightly carbonated smooth mouth feel. Overall an excellent readily available IPA.

Smell is apricots tropical fruit malts. Taste is ripe tropical fruit hops and I'm even getting some dark fruit like dates and plums. Very smooth with mild carbonation. This is a big and bold beer with complexity and cajones. A wonderful treat that is widely available here in NYC.

This comes right on the tail of my admittedly critical review of Dogfish Head's 60 Minute IPA and the fact that 90 minute actually saw completion before its younger cousin just might showcase a case of striking oil upon first dig.  The smell is a perfect mingling of pungent almost fruity hops with an absolutely insane merging of hop characteristics to follow in taste.  Earthiness dankness bitterness the whole shebang.  It finishes with a really well-rounded mouth-filling malt backbone that wraps up the whole experience all isolated to a single sip.  Nerdom complete.  This is a good beer.  You should drink it.

I am glad I tried it.  Look: Semi-clear copper hue with a thin white head.  Aroma: The citrus fruits and pine  Taste: The taste is sweet malts peach and mango some grapefruit pine.  Feel: light body crisp it’s very juicy. It is easy drinking despite the 90 IBU. Overall it is a great IPA.

Very rarely I am impressed at how a beer looks but this was by far the most visually appealing beer I have had in a very long time if not ever.  A beautiful ocher colored brew with heavenly white head a staying power that was impressive and a lacing that was more of a sheen than lacing - very impressive.  The smell was muted - not so strong with the hops not so strong with the spices but good nonetheless.  The feel was light yet crisp and somewhat biting - something else that was unique and unlike I have experienced.  The taste was way better than their 60-min offering but compared to other IPAs it ranks up there for the ones I have had.  Overall a very good IPA maybe not the best I've had but certainly the best I have had in recent memory.

Pours clean copper-orange color finger white head with great retention and lots of lace.  Tropical mango n citrus aroma with floral notes.  Toasty malt sweetness up front followed by mango grapefruit and melon.  A good bit of floral piney back end bitterness to balance the malt.  Medium soft feel.  One of the first IPAs I fell in love with so good.

On the nose I get a nice combination of hopsand malts.Very hard to pinpoint anything specificbut I do get some floral notes on the nose as well.  On the palate I get alot of sweets maltsblended with some piney hops.This beer is more sweet than bitter to me...It is a few months oldso I may need to try a fresh oneto get a fair assessment.  The body is thinwith a medium dry finish.  This was a pretty solid IPAbut nothing special.I may need to find a fresh oneto give a better analysis.But overall a pretty good IPA.

Excellent balance and a smooth hoppiness; definitely not overwhelming or in-your-face hops. DIPA/Imperial compare to others liked. Definitely buy again. 9% ABV. Note: Original rating was 4.25 Second review 6/29/17 ) Pours golden Amber with medium head and lacing to finish. Apparently my tastes have changed as Dogfish Head's self-described "pungent" smell/taste is now more a heavy influence: could not quite put my finger on it until a reader described it as a "very hoppy barleywine" and Dogfish Head noted "different grains" as influential. Bingo. Not a fan of barleywine or some grains with excessive influence. Smell taste aftertaste are all affected by this. Malts hops bitterness profile combine to overcome my bias. Personal preference leans toward several others: Green Flash West Coast IPA; Prairie Phantasmagoria; Founders Double Trouble; Stone Citracado; Stone RuinTen Triple IPA and Stone Ruination Double IPA 2.0; Sixpoint Resin Hi-Resin & Puff; Coop Alpha Hive. Still a good beer. 9.0% ABV 90 IBUs 1

This Medium to heavy weight beer has a woody yet well grounded and earthy taste that will give you something to enjoy in the moment yet bring you back with the memories of sipping this excellent beer for hours on end.

Sweet orange citrus & clean fresh water up front; a hint of coffee emerges as this warms. Delightfully drinkable with a mild hop bite. Perfect!

Little bit of lighter white head S (4.5) - Smells strong of hops.  I got more pine than anything else. T (4.5) - My sixer was old but still incredibly tasty.  This is arguably my favorite style and this is quintessential IIPA.  Deep complex caramel malts perfectly balanced by plenty of hops.  Hops would be more noticeable in a fresher batch. F (4.5) - Fairly carbonated but still easy to drink.  Not very thick O (4.5) - I had been wanting this for a long time and found one out of town that was old.  Bought it anyway and it was still very good.  Would really like to try it fresh but I'm a big fan.

Who cares? Love it first love it last. That is my relationship with this beer. If Sierra Nevada Pale Ale introduced me in my teens to good beer the 90 Minute introduced me to great beer in my 20s. The thing is when I go back to that well I remember every time why this beer is not just a classic but one that withstands the taste of time.

Descent taste just for my own personal preference prefer more bitter hoppiness versus sugar taste.

Nose of citrus and grapefruit a little passion fruit.  Flavors of toffee and caramel a bit off putting but follows up with a decent dose of tropical fruits like papaya and mango and passion fruit. A hint of coffee finishes it off.  Feel is mostly wet and carbonated leaving a slightly slick coating on the palate.  Overall a far cry from 120 minute but still a decent beer. Glad I was able to get a pint and not splurge on a 4 pack.

L: Golden orange quite clear pretty small white head with moderate retention & just a touch of lacing down the glass. S: Some hops but mild to me it's balanced with bready & mango aromas T: It's clearly well balanced with some citrus & bready flavours but to me the peach/mango sweetness comes through most noticeably.  There's just a hint of alcohol & pleasant bitterness at the end well hidden by the other tastes which come through more predominantly. F: Smooth & full Overall: It's clearly a great beer.  I tend to like IPAs & DIPAs with more citrus & less peach/mango but I really enjoyed this one & for its 9%abv it was ridiculously drinkable.  I would have enjoyed a dozen but alas had just one.

It has 9% alcohol and I'll drink a single bottle at night only when I need a heavy hit. Otherwise I'll drink something with less alcohol. The Dogfish Head 60 doesn't match the 90 and the Dogfish Head 120 is over the top. As with most of my beers I buy mine at Kahns in Indianapolis where they're kept in very cold cooler and have a rapid turnover. As I've said in other reviews the Imperial IPA hops fall off rapidly so these beers must be drunk at once. I suspect many bad IPA reviews come from beer that has lain in the refrigerator or on the shelf too long or not kept cold or gone bad at tap from an old seldom used keg. Always buy your beer from the brewery itself or from a cooler at a liquor store with rapid turnover. Take your chances at the tap unless it's close to the brewery and with high turnover such as 3 Floyds' Zombie Dust (Munster Indiana) on tap at Wrigley Field (Chicago).

The flavor was very malty initially but then the citrus undertones start to take over and coat your tongue very pleasantly. Not a fan of IPAs but i heard Dogfish Head has a great selection and was not let down. The head was small almost non-existent and the color was a darker orange tone. The smell was pleasant and reflected the citrus notes. The hops were not overbearing in the traditional sense as you would think of an IPA.   Overall it was a well crafted beer and i will enjoy it again perhaps over a grilled cheese next time! 
587,/beer/profile/64/2093/,4.51,look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5,Zythophile,Bottle Date: 6/15/16 Palate Contaminants: meat and potatoes  Appearance is a clear dark amber that's really more orange. Not much head.  The smell is like a hoppy marmalade. A little malt a little bit of floral scent. If it was a bit stronger the grade would be even higher.  Taste has more malt and less citrus but the degree of sweetness is in the proverbial wheelhouse for my own taste buds. There is also some bitterness up front but it fades quickly so to not wear out its welcome. There's a good amount of earthiness as well. The hops are the headliner but they're there to get along with everybody. The marmalade does get stronger as it warms up.   It's definitely similar to Burton Baton but less impactful and with a slight bit warmer feel. Not too carbonated not too flat just right. Not too boozy not too thin just right. It's easy to knock back so be careful since it's an niner.

It has that sweetness with a strong alcohol flavor but nothing too overwhelming.

Pleasent tropical fruit hop charecter with a toasty (perhaps too toasty) malt backbone. A little bit of grapey booziness on the very end. Good beer but perhaps a bit overrated. Would love this beer if the malt charecter was just slightly less roasty.

It poured an orange-bronze color with one finger of foamy egg-white head and extensive lacing.  It smells of sweet malt orange peel and resinous hops. The taste is a nice blend of malt and hops:  it features bready malt sweet fruit brown sugar and hops.  There is a slight bitterness at the finish but overall the hops don't bite.  You can also taste the booze. This ale has a nice thick body is moderately carbonated and the 9% ABV packs a punch.  Overall this is one of the best "malty" IPA's available. I don't drink it a lot but when I do I enjoy it!

The aroma has plenty of resinous hops character with hints of tropical fruit such as mangos and peaches. No malt backbone detected in the aroma. With the taste talk about a 360 degree turn with the "no malt" detection. Pretty much all I'm getting with the taste. Hints of resinous hops but the sweet biscuit like malt is the showcase. Mouthfeel is relatively thin but the malt profile still is mouth coating. Overall not a bad beer that's apparently accessible in many parts of the world.

This definitely an experience and I wouldn't rate it as a dipa because it doesn't have the profil. It's mostly on the dark fruits and the brown sugar from the malts. There is a load of pine and citrus hops. The toffee smell van make you think that's sweet but it's quite dry and balanced. Unique.

Poured out a copper color with an off white head about two fingers thick that slowly dissolved. Smells primarily of bread from the malts with a hint of pine to it. Flavor follows being primarily malt heavy with a little pine from the hops following. Flavor lingered a little again mostly the malt. Didn't notice much bitterness from the hops or really much hop flavor as is. Feel is light with no carbonation. Overall it's a decent beer but not one I think I'll pick up again too heavy on the malt for this style.

This beer gets a ton of hype but it really does not live up to it when compared to other IIPAs/DIPAs.  First off it is not balanced.  The malts overpower the hops in the smell foretaste and midtaste.  Only in the aftertaste do I get anything that resembles the sweet stickey pineyness of hops.  What does that mean in the grand scheme of things?  The color is spectacular but it is just an unbalanced average beer favoring the malt side of the scale which I do not prefer.  After about 30 minutes sipping smell resembles alcohol.  It know it's a 9+ percenter but other DIPAs certainly mask it much better in the aromatics and taste.

Nose of woodsy resinous hops but not too strong with a definite malty presence as well. Taste: a double IPA that is malt-dominant? Hops emerge from the malt as the taste evolves but this was not a "hops forward" IPA even though the hops are obvious and tasty. The flavor is more of a back-and-forth duet between malt and hops both making delightful contributions. Mouthfeel a little slick moderatly sudsy as good IPAs often are. A great beer.  Bottled 3/30/2016 per the bottle stamp.

I'm not sure if the batch I had was super fresh or if DogFish changed something about this beer. Whatever it is this was more delicious then I remembered. You can't go wrong with this one folks. Outstanding!

Smell is very malt heavy with a hint of hops. Light and well carbonated feel. Malt-forward taste with a finish of hop bitterness. Very good IPA and the malt forward approach makes this one stand out from the crowded field of hop-dominated IPAs.

Aroma came off more barley than hops.  Taste sweet.  Its a pretty standard beer which is a surprise for DFH.  There's some hops and bitterness that clearly establish this as an ipa.  There isn't a bunch of weird adjuncts.  Some pine a ton of malt and caramel.    I don't really know that bragging about a long hop boil is all that anyways.

Copper orange in colour well filtered with a thin white head that dissipates in a few minutes. Smells of simple malt and herbally earthy hops. No tropical and not much citrus to speak of. Easily distinguished as an imperial beer by its thick boozy caramelly sweet feel. It's been a while since I've had 90min and frankly I'm disappointed. It's good but not great. Spoiled by too many Vermont and west coast tropical fruity hop bombs I suppose. If you're not into that and like the malty potent ales this may be the one for you

Nose picks up in malts papaya hops.. Taste follows the nose. Flavors are almost perfectly in balance. A little more malt presence. Boozy finish.   Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat sticky and oily. One of my favorite treats. Heads and shoulders above most DIPA's I've had. A plus is that it's easily available.

Nice fine white head with residual bubbles on the surface that remain until the finish and revive with each sip. Great natural carbonation. Aroma is Pacific hop but not over the top hoppiness. Grapefruit-like citrus is present. Tastes right on. I like that the malt and yeast flavors aren't buried under lupulin. Lighter-bodied and goes down smoothly. The 9.0% is hard to detect in this delicious brew.

S: Smells of hops and a strong floral and fruitiness that is quite unique.  T: Good hops flavor combined with fruit and maltiness it has a bit of sweetness. It is very juicy to be sure moderate grapefruit flavor. Very drinkable at 9.00% abv this stuff is dangerous :)  F: Quite thick for an IPA a bit more like an ale then a "Clean" Ipa. Its is pretty smooth.  Very good beer not a super hopped IPA but quite tasty.

Light brown with orangish hue.  Smells of hops orange and a little clover.  Initial taste is hoppy but not overpowering. Nice finish with a very pleasant aftertaste. Well carbonated.  A nice lacing on the glass.

Aroma is strong and clean with piney floral hop aromas. Lots of flavor: raisins malt caramel citrus and some wood/pine near the finish. Not much bitterness especially considering the nose and IBU. Feel is full and moderately boozy. Overall this is an excellent and well-balanced DIPA. Very flavorful and not overwhelming in any direction.

Middle of the mouth alchool sweetness lots of orange flavor grapefruit citrus. Finishes with a piney grapefruit bitterness.some more sweetness at the end also. Overall: it's an awesome beer you get more malt in this then in 60 minute but it's needed in this beer. Lots of orange flavor coming through along with citrus flavores. It's a very awesome beer.

Good retention and lacing.  S: 4 Fairly strong malt on the aroma bringing honey and toffee. Hops are in the background with pine and orange. Nice aromas but a bit muted.  T: 4.25 Flavors are more aggressive than the nose suggested. Still a pretty strong malt sweetness up front but it’s nicely balanced by piney bitter hops. Mild graininess on the finish lingers with some more bitterness.  M: 4.5 Good body and carbonation. Slight dryness on the finish is really nice and the 9% is hardly noticeable.  O: 4.25 This is definitely a very good beer just not what I’m usually looking for in an IPA; it’s really more like an American strong ale.

S - Aroma is malty and hoppy. T - Flavor follows the nose. Just the right amount of bitterness. M - Medium mouth feel and carbonation. O - This is an outstanding IPA. Not the northeast citrus bomb or the piney west coast IPA. Carves out it's own niche in the IPA field.

It smells maltier that it tastes my fiancé would disagree though. In fact besides the sweet finish  it doesn't taste malty at all to me. As I drink on I change my 3.50 for feel to a 4.00 it seems to have taken on a heavier body. Still really sweet.  All in all this seems pretty basic. So it's a pretty good beer but it's not necessarily gonna be my go to when I'm looking for craft then I remember that it's 7% abv and I file it back into the league.  It's hard to figure out if I like it or not with this one.

Perfectly clear pale-amber with light khaki head. Thin film dense ring and light lacing.  Smell is dank and piney seems well balanced. Taste is also pine with grapefruit/citrus. Malty back comes forward later. Bitterness present throughout but extremely well balanced. Long finish with plenty of flavor.  Overall this is a classic and it has earned it's praise. Fantastic DIPA.

Good hop/malt balance actually wish it had more of a hop bite; but that's just my preference. Very strong beer alcohol is prominent in this one. I recommend aging them for a few months to a year like I do with the 120 minute. DogfishHead for the win! Salud!! 
906,/beer/profile/64/2093/,4.28,look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25,vladdswrath,Pours a deep but crystal clear copper with a big 2 inch head that holds form like a memory foam mattress. Smell is rich and fruity like juicy fruit gum layered under the usual citrus and pine. The flavor follows suit with the malt being a little sweeter than most brews yet offset by the hops being a little harsher than most. Even so they are balanced perfectly leaving you with an easy drink. Mouthfeel is chewy but not oily or sticky again very well balanced. This is a delicious brew that lives up to its reputation although I think the industry as a whole has caught up a little bit which makes this beer seem a little less special than it once probably was.

What was supposed to be a top notch IIPA is now in my opinion middle of the road at best.  Zero hop aroma or flavor and a total malt bomb.  Alcohol isn't well hidden.  Smooth and decent mouthfeel but so far from what a decent IIPA is nowadays.

It is the one I go to if I see it on draft the one I recommend to people if they want to try something out of their comfort zone. Hoppy yet smooth. Bitter yet drinkable. And a nice feeling afterwards. Best with some fish and chips on a saturday afternoon watching some EPL.

Look: Pours and settles a crystal clear orange color with a thin amount of white lacing resulting from non aggressive pour.  Smell: A lot of juicy tropical fruits up front consisting of mangoes and grapefruit along with some strong notes of earth and resiny pine along with the bitter hops.  Feel: Insanely light body almost like air and has a heavy amount of carbonation.  Taste: Actually seems like the opposite of the aroma. Very profound taste of the earthy resiny pine along with some hop bitterness up front. About midway through the juicy fruits appear and blend into the aftertaste along with one more bitter hop bite.  Overall: I usually steer away from the bitter beers but do enjoy them sometimes and I prefer the fruitier ones over the piney ones. This one seemed to be both at the same time between the aroma and taste along with the lightest mouthfeel of any beer I've had.

A biscuity note in the aroma along with a sense of sweetness accompanying the solid hop nose that has an earthly character.  Initial taste is of caramel sweetness followed by some mild bitterness and earthy hop flavors rounded out by a distinct yet moderate level of booziness.   The feel is above average with a nice carbonation level that seems to have a more delayed release with minimal head on initial pour but a good frothy mouth feel as it foams in the mouth.  Overall:  This is a very good malt-forward version of a double IPA and a good break from the more common bright and citrusy DIPAs that are hitting the market these days.  The 90 min IPA has a good balance of flavors that leans a bit more in the malty caramel direction than a hop bomb.  Great beer.

A great pour but the smell is a very musty strange scent. It tastes like it had sat on the shelf too long perhaps but I asked the store and they said it came in last week. Almost no "hoppy" taste whatsoever. It didn't taste bad just not even close to what I was expecting.

So little hop flavor. I buy this every once in a while hoping it will taste like it did 10 years ago but it's barely recognizable as an IPA. I love malty IPAs but this is a mess.

There is a musty raisiny unidentifiable funk almost like wet rug. There is so much hype surrounding this beer but I don't get it. I'm not one of those people that thinks increasing the quantity of ingredients and boil time is the best route for IPAs.  60 minute is a simple restrained yet in your face aromatic IPA and is much better than this.  Quantity does not equal quality in any way.

It is incredibly smooth for the IBU and ABV. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great fall beer and is tired of the boring Oktoberfest varieties.

The 90 IBUs and hops hit just right.  With a lot of IPA I get get citrus pine etc.  here it's almost like a clean hop-focused taste and pine hints are an after taste my brain barely picks up in.

Bottle poured into 16 oz. widemouth mason jar. Instinctive pour produces a nice off-white/nearly beige head. Lacing sticks to the glass--along with a half finger head. Superb on appearance.  S: Smells even better--Bubblegum with a malt background.  T: The malt presence here is what balances the beer to world-class standard. The flavour on this beer is unique and ultimately one of the best IPA's on the market. Maybe I'm alone on the malt-bubblegum profile but that's what I'm noticing. The most quenching IPA I've had.  F: Balanced while complex. Smooth with a sustain rigor to the beer all throughout. The feel to this beer is what really brings it all together as a world-class IPA.  O: It seems that most craft breweries aim to have the backbone of their business be a solid IPA. For some reason IPA's dominate the craft beer market. Don't get me wrong--I love IPA beer. But a lot of times what ends up happening is you get this hop override or a misguided malt presence. Dogfish 90 Minute is not only a contender--it might be the best IPA on earth. 1

LOTS. Very attractive Amber color. Nice head retention. Sexy lacing. Smell is just of a hop-forward beer but the taste is where it stands out from the rest. Piney resin with a malty sweet thick feel. Also a slow sipper for sure.

Feel: Syrupy;  Full; good carbonation.  Overall:  Really a different and very enjoyable pour.  Loved the sweetness paired with the  bitter grapefruit close: Looking forward to a rematch evaluation.

The fact that you can get a beer of this quality and freshness (just a few weeks old) on the train is a very good sign of the state of beer culture in America. I remember when the best you could get was a skunky Heineken there.   Into a clear plastic cup the beer is a very nice deep clear copper with a 1-finger light tan head. Smell was a little subdued but it is more on the earthy ripe fruit side though some pine was coming through. Some sweet malt too.   Beer tastes great. I like IIPA's like this that have some malt character to balance the hops. The feel is very good--highly drinkable but with excellent body. Neither watery nor oily which I don't love in IPA's.   Overall this is a super high-quality IIPA that I will gladly drink on the train or anywhere else.

Taste explosion of way too much malt and hops.  Feels kind of thick.  I did not like this beer but this is my first IPA.  I did not know what to expect but many people love this IPA.  It was awful from the first taste to me.  I know that others enjoy this Dogfish Head but I will not be getting it again.  I am glad that I only bought the one bottle or the others would have been poured down the drain.

Feels medium bodied creamy with moderate carbonation. Overall a nice malty and hoppy DIPA.

Hard to believe I've been drinking craft IPA's for a solid 4 years without trying this one. Great fruity hop aroma. Great balance in this 2x IPA. I get the big floral/citrus aroma balanced against a sweet (but not coying) malt backbone. Fairly good amount of pine in the flavor but it's complex. Gold beer.

I love this beer and while I have had others since that I enjoy more 90 min is still an outstanding brew.  It's a far cry from the trend of citrus fruit IPA's so if that's your bag you might not have a taste for this one.  There are some citrus/floral notes in it but nothing like a Fresh Squeezed from Deschutes or the like.  Overall a fantastic beer and one that I'll likely drink as long as they make it.

Pours a slightly less than crystal clear light amber with a off white head thas good retention and excellent side glass lace. Aroma: Has sharp pungent floral fruity and piney hops. Taste: Thick juicy hops dominate.  Orange rind citrus hops thick on the tongue.  Bready Malts are present and add some subtle balance. The 9% ABV warms with every sip. This is a beer that with each sip you savor  and appreciate.

A dark Amber pour. Smell and taste are consistent. Roasted malt is batman with the hop profile serving as robin. Not what you expect in an iPa. But if you free yourself from your preconceived notions. You can sit back and enjoy this great dipa.

Amber color with a nice creamy head that sticks around for a good while. Herby citrus smell. Tastes sweet and malty and hoppy... Like a Belgian that you had after cutting grass... But perfectly balanced... Very little alcohol sting on the initial taste but the high abv fills your mouth as you go. Weirdly a great sipping beer that tastes worse as you go... Though never bad... It just goes from orange juice to honey over time ... Which I'm certainly not mad at but is none the less awkward... I see what the hype is about - it's solid but I don't see this as someone I'll spend a lot of time with.

Slightly hazy and amber in color.  Nice firm head. Looks to be decently carbonated.  Hoppy nose with hints of pine and herbs balanced by a decent amount of sweet malts.  The taste is very interesting. The bitterness of the hops is strongly present but then makes place for a caramel like sweetness. The aftertaste is delicious and keeps lingering for a long time after you've taken a sip.  One of the smoothest beers I've tasted. It's juicy very balanced and carbonated just right.  Overall this is an excellent beer that deserves to be enjoyed by itself.

I am not a fan of big overly hoppy IPAs and was pleased to find that this one doesn't fall into that category. On the other hand I found this beer a little too malty and sweet for me. A little more hops and a little less malt and I think I would like this one better.

Smell: Very citrusy floral and malt notes with just a touch of hop resin. Not overpowering at all. Taste: Much maltier than the smell would indicate but there are distinctive citrus notes with just the right amount of hop bitterness to balance. Very slight alcohol aftertaste but you have to look for it. Feel: This feels like the perfect DIPA. Overall: This is exactly what I want in an IPA - great hop flavor without overpowering bitterness or resin character and a malt backbone to hold it all together. You'd never be able to tell it was 9% until it hits you.

S - sweet malt mixed with bitter hops and a light amount of citrus with some caramel and biscuit notes. The smell isn't overtly strong.  T - Follows the nose. Sweet malt mixed with bitter hops and a slight amount of citrus with some caramel and biscuit notes. A slight amount of earthiness to this one as well.  F - Medium body with a medium amount of carbonation.  O -  This is a great IPA that displays a good amount of malt and hop character. Compared to the 60 minute IPA I believe this one has a stronger hop presence and a somewhat thicker mouthfeel with less carbonation as well as a less malty profile. Overall this as well as the 60 minute are fantastic east coast IPAs.

Wouldn't age it much longer the booziness taste has faded but the smell remains. Which is what Ive noticed with many aged boozy beers. Beautiful gold 'apple juice' color with the smell of fire an alcohol. Tastes smooth and almost a vanilla quality mouthfeel sweetness that takes over middle of the mouth. With no bite on the back end.

Earthy citrus hops sweet caramel malts medium bitterness medium body. Very reliable DIPA and one of my favorites of the malt-forward variety.

Tasty but with lots of barley...maybe too much. Nice full taste but lacks in the ultra-hop that I'd prefer.

Very nice lacing.  Smell - Not as strong as an aroma as some of my favorite IPAs (AleSmith) but good earthy malt and hop mix  Taste - balance. malt citrus and nice hopping...smooth not bitter.  Feel - Medium body. A good chew. Warm going down.  Overall - A very good IPA but "best in America" not so much.  I have had this beer many times and in PA the quality ABV and price on tap/bottle can't be beat.

Medium carbonation  Smell - Floral spice earthy sweet caramel malts Taste - Follows the nose. Tons of floral/spice notes. Some earthiness. A lot of sweet caramel malts coming thru. A touch of bitterness on the back end. Feel - Medium/medium + body very sticky dry finish Overall - I feel this beer is overrated personally. I prefer my DIPAs to be citrus bombs while 90min is much more floral. If you love Victories Hop Devil or Bell's Two Hearted....you'll love this beer.

Appearance: hazy clover honey with a medium head that dissipates quickly. Nice lace left in the glass. The crown of the splash remained with larger bubbles longer than the other microscopic bubbles.   Smell: sweet musky esthery. Hints of pine. Resin and citrus.   Taste: milky hops with a bitter finish but also smooth and warm.  Feel: bubbly smooth  Overall: delicious - a bit stronger and more bitter than I would prefer but with lots of great qualities to round it out.

Served at 4deg C in a draught glass  A- Opens well and pours a 1" high white head that lasts for 3mins before film out. Dark amber color and filtered clear  S- Oodles of hops and malt. Sickly sweet.   T- Lots of hops but a touch bitter. Good overall blend. Nice extra boil with the sugar makes this one sing in your mouth.   M- Dry but a touch creamy  O- Very good. Had this one before which is why I invested into a 4pk. Would like to try on tap. Will buy again if I see it  Food Pairing  This nice brew went very well with....... Spicy chicken stir fry with oyster sauce bamboo shoots water chestnuts and sliced carrots. Throw some bean spouts on and it's a meal  Enjoy

The taste follows the nose with great a hop flavor.  Another great beer from an exceptional brewery. I had this numerous times on tap at the brewery. Well worth the trip out to the brewery. Highly recommended as it is consistently a good DIPA!

After admiring the the bronz/copper tones and big hop aroma the taste was just what I needed hops up frontmalt in the middle and hops on the sides yet balanced and smooth no boozy end flavors or astringent aftertaste. A Great beer to sip at and enjoy right down to the last drop.

Purchased while cross border shopping but it worked out to like $3.50CDN per bottle. No freshness label given.  Appearance -  Medium pour yielded a dark copper colored beer with just over one finger of sparkling fluffy white head. Very modest carbonation is made up for by great retention and a swath of lacing just plastered to the glass.  Smell - Big and boozy plenty of hops with a decadent caramel booziness with floral notes and roasted grain in the background.  Taste - Quite sweet not quite cloying due to lots of malt tastes like caramel with some floral hops up front too and the roasty grain in behind. Very tasty and well put together. Mild bitterness in the aftertaste despite 90 IBU's. Some heat arises as the alcohol content finally makes itself known. On the maltier side of DIPA's.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and sticky and the flavors cling to your mouth and lips. Carbonation is slight and the body is very full.  Overall - An excellently crafted DIPA that delivered everything I was expecting of it. I was hoping for more of a hop dominated DIPA but this is smooth and a very easy sipper. Would happily purchase this frequently if available in Canada. 1

Nose is a bit muted to me maybe because its less hop focused than similar brews. Resinous texture that comes off as sticky but not sweet. Orange and grapefruit notes.

Not to hoppy for the "non-hop heads" and yet definitely not another "run of the mill IPA".  This one stands out.  Easy to get and easy to drink makes a definitely great brew.

The beer pours a clear bright amber color with a large white head that left thick lacing.  The smell is sweet malt some floral pine and citrus.  The taste had a strong sweet make backbone to a piney and floral front. The mouthfeel is smooth with medium carbonation. Overall this is a balanced easy to drink beer but it has too much sweet malt for me.

The appearance was a glossy hazy pale orange color with a slim finger's worth of foamy to bubbly white head that quickly dissipated. The smell had a sweet grapefruit with some extra lemon and a balanced caramel malt. The taste was bittersweet fully all of the way. The mouthfeel sat about a light to medium with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed to follow the DIPA style. Nice grapefruit - sweet to bitter edge rolls over my tongue. Overall good for the style not sure why Esquire calls this the best IPA in the U.S. Hmmm...its good I just don't see it being the best one. I still have so many IPA's to try in life.

Thick chewey almost CREAMY mouthfeel - very unusual for an IPA.  Nowhere near as harsh as 60-minute. The maltiness is also unusual for an IPA.  It nicely balances the hops.  90-Minute is not sweet though - just well-balanced.  Alcohol is well hidden.  Very drinkable. Possibly my favorite offering from DFH (although that's what I say about 60-Minute and 120-Minute too).

Poured this after finishing my final paper for my last class for my B.A.  L: Beautiful sunburnt orange heavy one inch head that follows the beer all the way down. Good lacing too.  S: Light pine lots of English malts.  T: Spicy hops pine is gone. It's been replaced by medicial herby hops. Malt backbone is very present. It carries the beer. Definitely a change up from the usual harshness of the American IPAs i frequent.  F: Thought it was going to be heavily carobnated by the pour but it's only moderate. Mouthfeel is creamy and a little chewy and the head...man that head sustains the duration of the beer. I don't know if I finally got my glasses clean or what. But it's exceptional.  O: Love it. Excited to try 120 minute. Actually seemed less harsh than 60min. Extremely drinkable for the abv.

The English barley and malting make this taste more like a tart brown ale than an IPA. There's absolutely no pine or citrus tones to this which you expect from a good IPA. I was really hoping for more because I'm a fan of the 60 Minute. Luckily I only bought a single bottle. I'll take a Fresh Squeezed or a Sculpin over this any day.

Two fingers of off-white to tan creamy head has very nice sticking power. Pretty lacing.  Smell: Grapefruit and toasty English malts. Bready and a little soapy.  Taste:Toffee and grapefruit up front and lingers through out. A perfectly balanced bitterness on the back end. Its a little hot but you wouldn't guess it is 9% from just sipping it.  Feel: Perfect body. A little chewy a little sticky a little soapy. A perfect blend of everything I want from any IPA.  Overall: One of the best. Its not an over the top DIPA that I see from a lot of the west coast breweries. This one blends American and English sensibilities for something truly balanced.

A little copper colored for an IPA.   But the flavor really pops. Not super hoppy but well balanced as far as IPAs go. Subtle sweetness makes this delicious.

Aroma is a piney slighlty sweet malt and a touch of something almost spicy with hops or alcohol.   Taste follows the nose mostly. Pretty damn malty for an ipa even a double. But that makes it "crushable". Nice piney hop. Pretty resinous. I guess this is my first " east coast" ipa and its pretty friggin good.   Mouthfeel is smooth. Not heavynot light.  Little stickiness but overall smooth.   If you see this  def pick it up. Don't think twice freaking get it. Really good.

But it's really bitter which I like after one of these you want to drink some water because your mouthed dry. I love this brewery because it's dares to challenge all the rules of beer. This one is one of there best.

This beer is really good but be careful with it.

It has an excellent blend of bitter (at first) and sweet (finish). This might sound stupid but the mouthfeel is my favorite part... Heavy and thick while you are swirling and soaking in the richness.

Appearance: Clear gold/amber thick off-white head. Medium carbonation.  Smell: Big hop aromas fresh citrusy/piney maybe a hint of grapefruit. Also smells a bit sweet.  Taste: The draft is much better than bottle the bottle comes off as a bit sweet for me by comparison. This is a nice little hop explosion in the mouth without being overwhelming at all. Just a big hop flavor with a sweet malt backbone to keep it even. Supremely drinkable for a DIPA. The 9% ABV is well concealed I would have probably guessed more like 7.5% if I did not know better.  Mouthfeel: Medium/full body a bit thick but not when you take into account the ABV.  Overall: Quite possibly the sweet spot for dare I say it a session DIPA. Delicious but dangerously drinkable. This is my go-to beer as I can always find it and it's reliably excellent (unlike the 120 which is awesome but scarce and inconsistent year to year). Not as refreshing as the 60 so I typically would have one of these before or after dinner but not during. Have a draft with a really spicy snack and it is quite amazing. 1

Appearance: clear golden with a moderate off white foam cap. Aroma: Underlying resin and maltiness with a pop of grapefruit and peaches. Taste: Rich maltiness with fruity fig like flavors with a toasted edge giving way to a balanced bittereness that gradually increases in strength. Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation Finish: Dry resinous feeling left on the tongue with strong but not sharp Overall: A great classic IIPA. Strong enough malt backbone to balance the high IBU while remaining extremely drinkable especially for the style.

Simple mild aroma smells of grapefruit toffee and pineapple.  The taste is predictably hop-forward with prickly resinous herbaceous hops coming through straight away.  Alcohol provides tangible bite that accentuates the hops. The malt profile is bready with a touch of caramel sweetness.  Medium body and carbonation lay the foundation for a somewhat oily semi-creamy mouthfeel.  Perhaps three months is just too much age for an IPA to keep its form but this comes across a little coarse for my tastes.  There’s a biting aggressiveness that just won’t quit and it ends up overwhelming whatever details may be lurking beneath.  A very different animal from its milder 60-minute brethren.

I had it aged quite a few years and compared it side by side to the 60 Minute and 120 Minute.  Those are both fantastic but the 90 hits the sweet spot.  Maximum hoppy power that's stronger (and I mean this guy is strong!) and more intense than 60 but not an almost overwhelmingly sickeningly rich beer bomb like the 120.  Easily one of the best IPAs I've ever had this has a rich mix of flavors that still balance really well and let you know that this is a beer that they put some effort into.

I normally never drink from a bottle and always from a beer glass or wine glass.  Having said that I didn't love it it had nice hop notes but a peculiar finish that I was trying to pinpoint or more so to enjoy....I will have to try again from a proper vessel

Nice head retention with watery but ample lacing.  S: Very fruity. Every type you could think of. Dark/sweet/ spicy/ citric.   T/M: Very malty at first. Nuts and caramel. More sweet malts and grains. Fruits  are sweet and balance great with the bitter hops. Hop flavors are strong but never overpower the rest the flavors. A spiciness comes in with a strong bite. Alcohol burn comes in a little. Aftertaste is juicy.  O: Amazingly balanced IIPA. Complex without the hop bomb of newer beers. It also has a distinct taste which helps pull it away from other clone IPA's.   Cheers!!!

Appearance: Pours a bright amber color with quite a bit of white head. The lacing is very evident as each sip leaves a personalized ring on the glass (note enjoyed out of a pint glass rather than the suggested snifter)  Smell: Right off the bat I get quite a bit of fresh hops. As I continue to drink this beer I can smell something citrus and sweet. Not sure if they are part of the same flavor or two completely different flavors.  Taste: This is a very mild/smooth beer for its style (compared to some others I've had like Hopslam) and I really like that about it. The citrus smell I was getting I can definitely taste as well as that sweet smell. The first taste that really hits me is pine and the rest of the flavors seem to follow with a slightly bitter hop finish.  Mouthfeel: Not quite as filling as I'd like it to be which makes it unbelievably drinkable. For a beer 'best savored from a snifter' this one is a little too easy on the taste buds. Carbonation sounds high upon opening the bottle but I actually got a light/moderate level of carbonation.  Overall: Being relatively new to BA (but not craft beers) I've had my eyes opened to different highly rated beers. Being relatively accessible I want to try what I can. I was pretty impressed with the smoothness of this beer given what it has to offer. Definitely glad I bought a 4 pack of it and will definitely buy it again in the future. 1

A - Beautiful deep orange color. Mostly clear with a big bright white head and great lacing.  S - Pungent hop fragrance with lots of citrus grapefruit pine and resiny tones. Could smell it before I picked it up. Almost perfume like from the magnitude of aromatics.   T - Full flavored with a ton of hop character that has citrus resin pine and grapefruit.  Full bitterness but it is complimented by the hop candy like sweetness on the front of the tongue. The malt is lighter and only stands to compliment which is how I like my DIPAs. It is cleaner and more of the straightforward citrus/grapefruit character than some of the new DIPAs but overall great flavor.  M - Full mouth-feel with good carbonation. This beer has all the flavor but with higher carbonation and significant bitterness this one doesn't stick to the palate profusely.   Overall a terrific DIPA. Great aroma flavor feel appearance but with some serious hop bitterness to go great with spicy foods. There are more tropical hop flavored beers out there but this one does the more traditional West Coast style perfectly. This brew is serious on the tongue and I would strongly recommend it to anyone that likes hops.   Glass- Tulip 1

Much more head on this one and the "malt backbone" gives it a sweet taste. Really sweet. I really like both the 60 and 90.....60 if you like more of hop/slight bitter taste 90 for a sweeter creamier complex taste. Both great beers I will buy regularly. I think the sweetness makes this more of an introductory beer for those new to craft IPAs.  One of the best beers I've had.

Pleasant and mild aroma consisting mostly of hops and grass (maybe more floral than grassy) but I could pick up whiffs of citrus (orange mostly) and mild buttery caramel. It pours sparkling golden-orange with nice finger-width slightly off-white head consisting of evenly sized small bubbles. This pour had the benefit of a glass which must?ve had etching on the bottom - there was a constant stream of carbonation feeding the head giving it a presence throughout the drink (the flute has an etching on the bottom) and leaving a nice lacing around the glass by the end. Even in a plastic glass the head retention is generous creamy and fluffy and has a lot of sheet lace. The taste is a balanced medium high citrus bittersweet. It?s a nice medium body a bit sticky with a mild hop flavor lingering. The constant head gives it the benefit of being creamy and frothy throughout but it doesn?t feel fizzy at all. It’s a medium body a bit sticky that’s creamy and thick but also smooth with flavors of bread toast biscuit and caramel with some citrus. There?s a reason Dogfish Head gets so much credit for their beers and this is a shining example of how to make and Imperial IPA without over-doing any aspect of it. 1

It was my first beer I had when I turned 21 and it is still amoung my favourites. It has wonderful balance and I couldn't recommend this brew more if you haven't tried any of Dogfish Heads brews I would say run to the store and pick some of this up crack open a few and enjoy brewing perfection. Its just a good honest beer that is very drinkable and not overpowering in any way. This is how a Imperial IPA should taste in my opinion.  5/5  O.B.D91

M: Creamy smooth fine soft medium to medium high carbonation medium full body slight warmth from the alcohol.   O: Big deliscious Imperial IPA with just the right balance between alcohol malt fruit and hop.

It actually has a smooth feel to it which is a pleasant surprise. Overall in terms of flavor I am more of a fan of the 60 minute IPA but this is still a masterpiece of a beer from an elite microbrewery. I would love to get my hands on the 120 minute IPA which is the granddaddy of them all in terms of ABV

1836,/beer/profile/64/2093/,4.32,look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25,m_hall,Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip.  A hazy orange-amber ale topped with an off-white one-finger head that has decent retention. Very good lacing as to be expected from a heavily-hopped ale.  Aroma is sweet citrus fruits vanilla garnished with a floral hop overtone. Not as pungent as many IPAs though.  Flavors are rich fruits  banana caramel malts light pastry-like breads up front.  Grapefruit lemon zest and pine-y hop notes come in strong after but the strength of the malt backbone keeps the 90 IBU bitterness from devastating the taste buds.  Finish is fairly long and sweet/sour accompanied by a noticeable alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel is smooth and and not overly heavy. The body of this rather malt-heavy beer is offset by a fairly strong carbonation.  A well-known well respected Imperial IPA who's reputation is well-deserved.  The muscular malt character here does much to offset the strong  hops.  Many die-hard hop-heads may not appreciate this as  the result lacks the overwhelming blast of hop-bitterness that many other IPAs flaunt.  Those who like a heavier beer and enjoy the malt aspect as well as the hops will find much to love here. 1

Has a relatively pronounced taste of alcohol but the hops do help in disguising that. On the higher side of ABV at 9% thus it can pack a pretty nice punch. Not the best IPA I have had or even among them but it is a solid choice and readily available.

Clear amberish in the glass.  Smells of sweet caramel malt and pine with a touch of citrus.  Taste pretty much like the smell.  Strong malt base great pine shows thru with some citrus.  Very thick and resinous on the tongue.  For those looking for a cheaper beer close to this try rodeo clown

The flavor did outdo the alcohol which I suppose is a decent feat of brewing.  The warmth of the booze hits your stomach but the candied citrus taste is rich enough to hide it when drinking.  I expected more from this with the attributions proudly displayed on the label.  Overpriced I think.  Banking on the reputation I suppose.   I won't say the Emperor has no clothes here but they could use a little tailoring.

Malty and sweet with moderate bitterness. Not nearly as hoppy as I had hoped.

With carbonated bubbles emerging from the bottom of the glass. Smells of citrus pine and sweet. It tastes similar to how it smells with mild carbonation. Went down very easy and the notes of citrus combined with sweetness in the taste made it very enjoyable.

Pours a very clear amber color with a 1.5 finger white head of foam. Good carbonation lots of bubbles streaming up. Smells sweet and fruity; grapefruit mango oranges and pineapple. Also slight notes of banana and spice. Nice mild taste. I get pine citrus grapefruit orange and kiwi. Sweet yet tart on the back end. Dry sticky aftertaste.  Overall a decent IPA. It didn't prove to be what I've heard. In comparison to a lot of 9% IPA's this beer is tame and mild. I'd call this a session beer if anything. Again not bad just not what I was hopong for. Maybe too balanced if that's possible..

Now that I'm used to strong beers I can appreciate the 90 Minute IPA much more. I love the sweet malts and how well-balanced this is. So much caramel and toffee with some sweetness. Awesome beer that was around before all the trendy breweries of the past few years. This one will withstand the test of time.

I got a lot of bread off the nose with this one along with some pine and earth tones alcohol is hidden well in this.  strong bitter pine to start and mellows out with the barley flavor.  Very well rounded taste from start to finish.  Mild aftertaste. light to medium carbonation with this one.  Felt very full yet smooth to drink.  Unlike most IPAs out there (especially this one is hopped for 90 minutes).  The barley really mellows out that dank and bitter hop taste. Overall Im glad I picked this one up.  On a different spectrum than a lot of the IPAs out there that scream bitterness.  Ive had 60 minute a few times but this is my first 90.  Will definitely get this one again.

Smells of hops (pine/grapefruit) very floral rich bread like aroma Sweet forward with a nice balance from the hops and clean finish. Not syrupy nice astringent quality synergies with hops and hardly detectable ABV.   Overall a very enjoyable beer in a blind taste test - I was unable to differentiate Lagunitas Brown Shugga' and this beer. Either a testament to how great these beers are or how unrefined my palate. Regardless I would put this on my rotation of great American IPA.

Full disclosure: I am not an IPA fan generally sticking with stouts porters and some dark lagers.  But there was a lone bottle in my local grocery store and I thought why not.  So with that in mind... I started this around 56F.  It poured an OMG beautiful golden amber perhaps the prettiest beer I've seen.  Nice whitish head that lasted long enough to appreciate.  Smell was mostly citrus hops.  Maybe some grapefruit but definitely citrus.  Aroma was the weakest link.  Taste followed but slightly out performed the aroma.  Feel was medium body and quite creamy.  In fact there's many a stout that could take a lesson.  I found myself wanting to really like this beer but ultimately it is not my thing.  My rating is probably unfair because I'm not into IPAs but if you are or want to try one I heartily recommend this beer!

Lots of lacing. The beer is a bright amber almost orange hue very clear  S: smells like fresh beer with considerable hops. Some pine notes with prominent sweet and malty tones  T: hoppy and earthy but can still appreciate the malt  M: this is where this beer really shines. If you were to look at it and how clear it was you'd never guess it had this creamy full-bodied mouthfeel. It's really exquisite  O: I can see now why it's rated so highly. It's a simple IPA in that it doesn't have tons of citrus and spice and floral and pine etc but it has a beautiful look with an awesome mouthfeel and a very traditional IPA taste

Appearance: Orange colored with a nice 1 finger head. Lacing is present as expected. Looks like I should drink it.  Smell: Awesome. Citris and Pine with some sweetness from the malt and resin from the hops. Smells very fresh. The head is just slowly dissapating popping hop aroma all over the place.  Taste: Boom! Tastes following the nose here. Very big and bitter with pine and citrus. Malt is sweet and balances the power of the hops. You can taste the booze but its terciary at best. Love it. My favorite of the 30 60 90 75 and 120.  Mouthfeel: Very well done here. Just the right amount of carbonation as to not make this big beer feel heavy while drinking. DFH always does a fine job with this.  Overall: In a world plastered with DIPAs and Hopbombs this carries DFH's flag very well imo. Very easy to drink and never disappointing. I could pop several of these and dissapear in a resiny citrus euphoric mess. Well done!

It's called malt! Your IPA needs it. This one has it. A very finely crafted brew deserving of its fame.

Maybe the malt backbone doesn't impress me anymore maybe I prefer a more pronounced hoppiness these days. I haven't had the 90 minute in about 10 months and back then she was the hot babe. Now....still good but not as good as I remember. Tastes change I guess

I was disappointed again.  It does have a unique flavor when compared to other similar beers but it doesn't work for me.  The hop flavors were offset by a yeasty english brown ale flavor and I didn't get any multiphase taste variance.  Still - pretty good.

My wife seized the opportunity while I was finishing my pale ale reviews to help herself to the 90 Minute IPA's chilling in the fridge. I was able to get a 5 oz. sample out of the deal though. LOL. Even in her IPA tulip the beer demonstrated amazing clarity. You can see every detail of your hand holding the glass through the body of the beer. I really like the copper-amber appearance with its unique cinnamon highlights. The frothy 2 finger head and ample uneven lacing add to the allure. The aroma has a nutty brown ale quality with an abundant rustic hop character. Scents of sweet breads mingle with hints of sour citrus. I'm actually surprised by the super malty flavors of this one. A bold brown sugar sweetness compliments the myriad hop complexities and threatens to steal the show. Noticeably absent is any real sense of bitterness. Typically with a mega-hopped brew of this stature you can expect a dry bitter bomb. Not the case at all with this one. Instead you get a lot of nice fruity flavors  earthy spice a little mint and very reserved citrus pith. Everything comes together in a rich hearty body. The perfect carbonation helps create a creamy texture that might just be the best I've ever had in an IPA. This may also be the only DIPA that I've had where the malts truly stack up to the hops and the resulting balance creates an entirely new understanding of what an IPA can be. Make no mistake at 90 IBU's this one is not lacking in the hop department in any way. It's just a bit of sleight of hand for the malts to seduce you in to thinking you may have a barleywine in your possession instead. Admittedly the sweetness can become a little much but no more so than the bitterness of most other Imperial IPA's. In the world of creative craft beers this one stands out to me for its originality and pure personality. 1

Great dark amber color. Nice 1 finger head and great lacing tull glass is empty! Almost sweet initial taste with the hops kicking in midway  and ending with a smooth aftertaste. Creamy mouth feel. One of the better double IPA's I've had

The description talks about a solid malt backbone.  For me this really made the beer.  Gave an awesome balance to the strong hop presence and a nice substantial mouthfeel.

No lacing on the glass.  Smell: Very strong hops with mild malts and citrus.  Mouthfeel/Taste: Smooth medium to full bodied. Taste of very strong hops with citrus and some mild malts.  Overall: Very good IPA! Personally one of my favorites.

Lots of lacing.  S: Bready malts up front. Lots of raisins. Light piney hops at the end.  T: Pine and bitterness from the hops up front. Lots of malty sweetness. Dark fruit and Turbinado Sugar make up a lot of the taste of this along with the perpetual oily hops. Ends with piney citrus.  F: Medium carbonation and feel although heavier than other DIPAs I've had.  O: I haven't had this in years. It was my first taste of IPAs and I could barely drink it. I now find it to be a world-class dynamic beer. I'm glad I revisited!

This one has a "presence" the the 60 Minute lacks.  I also enjoy the 120 Minute IPA but the 90 Minute is the sweet spot for me.

An intense blend of pungent resiny oily hops along with an oh-so-sweet malt profile. Big in flavor and big in mouthfeel - there is a stickiness here that clings to your palate.

2229,/beer/profile/64/2093/,4.2,look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25,Tbub18,A - amber caramel honey color and solid one finger head  S - very unusual for an DIPA the roasted barley dominates giving it a smell more akin to a brown ale or even dare i say a smoked porter?  not as hop forward as i would have expected.  grapefruit is there but the barley is the biggest takeaway  T - malty hoppy and bitter with an almost smokey aftertaste.  compared to its 120 brother this is much more drinkable less sweet and less boozy.    M - creamy medium-bodied low carbonation  O - while i found this interesting and enjoyable i'm sure some people would find it too barley heavy.  it's a good beer but would not be my first choice if i was looking for a classic DIPA

2282,/beer/profile/64/2093/,4.5,look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5,Harvest06,A: Orange in color. S: Piney hop aromas subtle malts. The hop smells are nice and rounded. No one hop aromas overwhelms. T: Beginning is citrus and fruity hops middle is slight sweet malts. The dry finish has a bitterness that cleanses the pallet without being overly bitter while hiding all 9% of the abv. M: Medium body. O: This is the Imperial IPA that sets the standard. All Imperial IPA's are better or worse. Its well dry hopped well balanced and dry but with a slight sweetness.  This is truly a world class IPA fresh. Take note of the bottling date on the neck of the bottles as this is excessively dry hopped and much better fresh. Like all dry hop IPA's this will begin to lose its hop aroma after 30 days and be quiet noticeably less aromatic after 60 days.

Perfect balance of Grapefruit and citrus taste. Wonderful aromas of sweet pine. If u are not much into IPAs wait till u r ready for this masterpiece. Give your palate time to adjust to the buttery greatness. You will never regret buying it. Salud! Cheers! Enjoy......

Citrus and exotic fruit taste on top of a sweet malty base that masks the ABV quite well. Would love to try this fresh. 
2317,/beer/profile/64/2093/,4.13,look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25,PolarBear3,A - Pours a orange/Amber honey colour with frothy white head that retains fairly well  S - Strong citrus notes including grapefruit bitter lemon with light sweet malty aroma  toffee and caramel.  T - Prominent grapefruit tangy citrus hoppy up front but balanced nicely with some of that sweet malt with a very slight bitter finish..Impressive.  M - Low Carbonation but medium bodied that goes down well  O - Terrific beer! Not your normal IPA but is balanced extremely well and a definite must try

If this was billed as an American Strong Ale it would get a higher rating from me. Tastes alright but it's cloyingly sweet and not hoppy enough. Has some disgusting molasses and licorice notes. Some bitterness but absolutely NO citrus cat piss or agressive hop character. This beer is fresh too (bottled 11/14/14 and today is 12/17/14). Every time I try Dogfish beers I like them less and less.

Not necessarily the *best* 2IPA (PtY is great yah?) but awesome and ubiquitous. Orange-gold color unfiltered/opaque look light head. Rich mouthfeel consistent with the unfiltered look and the sweet taste. Somewhat sweet. Offset by lots of hops for sure. Citrus. Really well balanced once you get used to the sweetness. Good with food without food basically it's good with being alive. Better draft like so many others - alas not more common.

2446,/beer/profile/64/2093/,4.49,look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5,dutesanch,Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Color is a clear rust/copper color with a fine head and lengthy lacing. Smells of sweet hickory BBQ can't describe anyway else. Taste is very malty up front with almost no hop bite and a mildly sweet smooth finish. Drank on 12-3-14 bottled on 9-23-14 but bottle says it ages well. This IPAin a blind taste test would pass as an Amber IMO. Doesn't carry any traditional IPA characteristics but DFH isn't traditional either. They just make good beer the way they want and this is a good beer. Way too smooth and easy drinking for a 9% beer. Will be buying more!

(maybe a sniffer or tulip would have been better)  Appearance: The color is a thick golden honey color. The lacing is perfect that shows a line with each large or small sip.  Smell: The smell is a carmal toffee pine hop with a touch of malt.  Taste: This one is hearty wholesome hops w/ notes of caramel toffee hints to make a chewy mouthful beer. The smoothness is incredible followed by a thick essence of malty alcohol goodness.

If I had never tasted the younger this may have been my first 5/5. Thanks to all at RR- it has been a rare privilege- I will be back .... and in the meantime if anyone says what about a tap takeover in Brisbane - you guys would smash it out of the park - my dream job - RR rep in OZ!!!!!!!!!

Huge floral and piney flavor with a hint of citrus. Medium feel with a big dose of hops at the end. Havent had many of the northeast brews and if they are better i cant wait to try them because this is the best beer I have had by a good margin

This beer is still perfect among west coast ipas. Bitter piny extremely balanced and dry without any apparent alcohol present and coming in a dated bottle. Pliny is world class!

The pour is golden brown with a nice head. Strikes a good balance between bitter and malt assuming you love hops. One of my faves...when I can find it!

Still done well but competing with New England style orange juice looking brew. I have suggested to the brewery about doing an unfiltered version.  Well at least I suggested that to the guy outside who checked me in..

Delightful sweet pine aroma.    Taste is about the most perfect balance of pine and citrus hops.    Perfect mouthfeel clean dry finish - just want to keep drinking more.    I might prefer the more intense taste of others out there but this is definitely one of the best.  Just wish it wasn't so pricey and always in short supply.

Nothing really stood out.  Had fresh at the brewery brought home bottles and hosted a tasting with a nice assortment of Vermont IPA's and two Tree House brews.  Pliny was at the bottom of the heap universally.  Wanted to be blown away but it just didn't do it.  Granted the style is different from New England IPA's.

Light blond clear pour minimal head and carbonation. Strong pine aroma hops mixture of sweet and strong hops. One of the strongest aromas from a beer I have ever had. Hops and pine predominant tastes. Strong mouth feel firm dry pleasant drinking. Overall excellent beer thanks David for the tip!

This beer is great.  It's nothing above that.  You get a beer that is 8% + and doesn't have a bitterness.... THAT IS IT.  PLEASE STOP with this whole best beer ever crap.  This beer gives you not much flavor. Yes it's lacking flavor. It's just simply not what you could imagine. I love that it has low bitterness at 8% that is great... but guess what. So do ALOT of beers at this level. So pliny you are not worth the greatness in Oregon at least. Take a back seat..

I happen to love it and consider it the Gold Standard in American style IPAs. Fellow hop heads will say its over-rated no so great etc. I call bullshit. Its an awesome beer when you can get  your hands on some and never let it age the quality suffers quickly.

If you can understand the difference and why that matters then maybe we can all stop hyping Pliny so much. Still if you can get your hands on this beer do so. You won’t be disappointed.

Nice piney hoppy flavor.  Not too bitter.  Has an incredibly smooth almost salty finish.  Not too boozy for a DIPA.  Just perfect.

Pours a lovely golden with a finger of thick white foam which remains as a cap the whole way down.  Bands of lace remain in the beer's dissipating wake.  Smells dank piney of overripe fruit.   Tastes fruity piney resinous dank.  Slick mouthfeel.  Great light bready backbone.  Emphatically bitter.  Smooth. Far too easy to drink.  Alcohol not detectable until the long bitter resinous finish.  Towards the end of the glass the bitterness vanishes and it's just smooth hoppy goodness.  Epitomy of the West Coast IPA.

I just wouldn't line up around the block for it. Its a DIPA thats smooth and not crazy hoppy while maintaining sort of a floral backend to it. Its light and easy to drink but I find myself wondering if this beer was easily accessible would it still have the same ratings here?

Less than a month old with a strong malt backbone.  Better than most west coast IPA's but in the saturated market the king has lost his crown these days.

Good retention and great lacing. A little paler than Blind Pig which was surprising. Bottle is like the Dr. Bronner's of beer      S -- Grapefruit new sneaker pine pineapple grass and a touch of booze. Not too in your face but clean      T -- Starts semi-sweet with a pleasant honey sweetness and a wave of white peach and grapefruit hoppiness. This is abruptly followed by a robust resinous bitterness that continues to the mildly astringent herbaceous black-tea-like finish. A hint of green coffee beans as well      F -- Medium+ mouthfeel medium carb. Booze is a little perceivable. Long-lasting finish       O -- Glad to finally be trying this one. While it is definitely no longer king of the roost it is beautifully put together given the date of its initial release.  84/100

Pours a lovely golden straw with a bit of a chill haze and a foamy dense pure white head that sticks around. Aroma is citrus pine and stone fruit with a hint of candied fruit. Amazing taste. First sip starts bitter pine and grapefruit pith. Strong finishing bitter bite. As it opens up sweeter citrus and stone fruit comes through. I get a lot of peach. It gets better with every drink. Mouthfeel is medium smooth well-carbed and crisp. Outstanding all around beer.

There are several comparable Double Imperial IPAs that are as good without the hassle. This has become an overrated also ran.

272,/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.63,look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75,NilocRellim,Pours a clear vibrant marigold colour. Citrusy hoppy aromas sweet pale malts piney hops and a little spicy. Smells big and rich. Heavy bodied but the flavours are lighter than expected. Earthy hops citrusy fresh spruce tips a bit of passion fruit some floral notes and a squishy body throughout. Balanced and well-rounded with a clean finish.

Some mild floral notes. Taste is incredibly smooth. Goes down way too easy. Nice clean bitterness balanced by a very nice malt backbone. One of the most balanced IPAs I've ever had. Pine floral caramel grapefruit taste. Excellent beer. Definitely one of the best.

A: pours a brilliant gold with one finger of very bubbly just off-white head. Little visible carbonation to speak of. Retention is good lacing average.   S: some DIPAs can be smelled as soon as the cap is opened or the bottle is poured; in not getting that here. But as I bring my nose over the glass I am immediately inundated with tart tropical tangy and resinous goodness. Kiwi key lime raspberry hint of pine. All of it is underpinned by a clean sweetness.  T: dank! Arrival is immediately hoppy citrus grapefruit peel mild crackery maltiness with a hint just a hint of sweetness. Balance? No way! But I am surprised by how not bitter it seems. Toward the end it becomes less citrusy and more piney and then dank - more herbal tasting than any beer I have ever had.   M: lighter side of medium modest carbonation pretty darned attenuated and only a little slick.  O: I would say this lives up to the hype. It is a crisp clean and super hoppy DIPA with no presence of alcohol whatsoever and not much bitterness. It is the definition of the west coast IPA.   Basically every IPA (and most pale ales) I've had over the last year are trying to be this. Five years ago I can only imagine what this was like to the devoted hop head. Alas I am not a devoted hop head. An extremely generous friend brought this home for me and for that I am endlessly grateful. However time and travel do this beer no favors. I have had better Bodhi and Mystic Mama that comes darn close. Hope to have it in Cali someday for the sake of comparison. 1

Clean refreshing hoppy goodness. Drink it cold and fresh. I'd tell you where I found it but I can't. This is my happy place. Though I'm 3000 miles away I need to know there will be some left there on tap if I ever return. If you can find Pliny drink it. It is the Holy Grail of beers!

Lots of pine and sweet aromas in nose.    Bitter but well balanced.  Citrus mango berry flavors.  Sweet viscous vanilla and pine in flavor. Smooth syrupy finish. Lots of alcohol. Very drinkable. Excellent IPA.

Poured into a Bruges glass Bottles On date was 04/24/17. 8% ABV.  Look: Deep golden hue small head of foam even carbonation flow from the base of the glass. Smell: An incredible combination of sweet breadiness bitter citrus and piney hops. Beautiful floral balance. Taste: An amazing hop explosion. Loads of grapefruit give a perfect balance to piney resinous hops. Still a subtle breadiness but just as a noticeable afterthought to the beauty that is Pliny! Feel: Very smooth. Sharp seltzery carbonation that is very smooth as it goes down. Incredibly crisp the perfect summer IPA (that for many is a one summer in a lifetime).  Okay so as I predicted this beer is far from overrated. Its balance is incredible and true hopheads will be able to truly appreciate the bitter grapefruit herbs and piney hops all being perfectly balanced into an amazingly easy drinking DIPA. If you ever get your hands on this don't pass it up. The fact that you can still grab it for under $10 is beyond me because I would easily pay more to try this again.  UPDATE: Rating slightly amended on 2/23/18.. still an amazing beer but a 5 across the board is unrealistic even for Pliny. 1

Glad to finally have the opportunity to try this one (thank you Denver).  Pours a straw yellow with a touch or orange.  Dank and resinous.  I expected more complexity from this beer - particularly given its pedigree - but it tends more towards one not which it hits and hits well.  This beer trends more towards the blend of dank thick and piny that Heady hit so well and did it well before that time.  It's a great piece of craft beer history and still holds up well but though it's an exceptional beer it's no longer one (in my opinion) that warrants a place among the best of the best.  Though it may have been the first many breweries have come along duplicated and improved upon what this beer had going.  Excellent but no longer world-class.

Golden color with slight burnt orange highlights.  Pours a bubbly soapy head that fades a bit but is easily coaxed back by swirling. S: Bread and earthy almost like a nice bread baked with basil and other herbs.  Slightly sweet aroma with minor hints of ethanol has a bright citrus zest note. T: Repeat of nose with bread and earthy flavor.  However hops come through here with notes of citrus mostly a sweet grapefruit rind note.  Finishes with a very soft bitterness.  To me its impressive that this bitterness is so soft and this is coming from a New England boy. F: Ridiculously smooth.  Mouthfeel is soft smooth and easy-drinking.  There's a bit of a crispness from the carbonation but its pretty balanced.  Very refreshing.  Only critique would be that its a bit thin O: Extremely good beer has a good malt/hop balance very drinkable very tasty.  If this was readily available it would be a summer staple of mine. 1

Very floral nose with some pine and a touch of citrus peel. Won't know you're drinking a DIPA as finishes much cleaner and lighter than most. I'll admit that for me it didn't live up to the hype but a very clean crisp and bright beer. Definitely deserves accolades but by no means blew me away. However it's a pioneer beer for the style and I certainly wouldn't turn it away if offered.

A bright gold color with a small white head. Beautiful aroma. Floral and citrus hops with a little bit of pine. Good malt background. Grapefruit and orange up front followed by some pine resin. Caramel. Very balance very good.

I don't have much to add to the multiple exhaustive reviews. Currently drinking an extremely fresh one. I've had to downgrade its rating slightly after trying many other IPAs and DIPAs. However I still marvel at how complex yet simple it is. If that seems like an oxymoron allow me to explain. It is complex in the depth of its layers. The smell is uber fresh fruity and hoppy citrusy and piney spicy grassy woody and even a little nutty. The flavor starts with a nice bitter grapefruit rind punch along with some apicrot orange lemon zest and pine and then you notice some grass and herbs wood resin even. A faint malt sweetness comes into play as well as a dry cracker-like backbone that all serves to mellow out the bitterness adding texture and body like soaking up some lemon juice with bread. Finally comes a dry and bitter fresh grapefruit finish reminding you again of its primary mission and asking you to take another ride. I don't detect alcohol. Its simplicity lies in the ease with which these layers are identified -- its lack of busyness. Its mission is singular -- to provide a bitter fresh yet balanced and ultimately extremely drinkable DIPA.  Each individual attribute may be found to a greater extent in other beers but its precise balance of attributes is unique and maintains it as the reference standard for DIPAs. 1

Nose is floral pine with a bit of light citrus. Beautiful taste transition first you get that smooth light citrus orange and grapefruit peel fades to floral and then finishes pine like. Minimal malt profile here but it is still a balanced beer meaning they loaded up this beer on it's malt base almost to the tipping point with hops but stopped short at the Percy amount! Nice clean bitterness to it if you let it sit on your tounge. Mouthfeel starts out sticky but quickly transitions to a crisp bitter clean finish that leaves your palate dry and craving for more Pliny! Excellent beer.

Smell: Hops citrus and faint pine.  Taste: Fantastic balance of hops and citrus ending with pine notes.  Feel: Crisp and clean.  This is a highly sought after beer in San Diego county and hard to come by at times.  I've had it on tap and bottled both have their advantages.  If you are a fan of IPAs Pliny the Elder will not disappoint

The head buildup is significant on a medium pour with a combination of soapy and frothy head adorning the clear body.  Lacing is quite heavy.  Nose is of floral hops to me.  There's a little honey-like sweetness with a bit of spice.  I get a little evergreen note with some warmth and effort not as obvious as others have noted.  With this I also get just a slightest note of onion/garlic that some doubles give off. Revisit: Little more citrus orange rind and light sweet grapefruit pith and a little more power overall up a notch  The taste is a little more evident especially in the pine notes.  The beer opens as the nose indicated with a nice honey cracker malty opening.  The pine is light on a colder brew but blooms nicely as the beer warms. A light tickling of the carbonation leads to some anticipation before dissolving into the pine notes.  These start more woody but slowly move up the tree from trunk to green branch to pine needles.  Further warmth allows me to note a light tangerine citrus rind note right after the carbonation fades.  The malt opening comes out the other side as the bitter flavors fade though the lingering taste is a woody pine bitterness. Revisit: maybe I took so long to analyze the first time I'm thinking the same here just a little easier to detect.  I honestly expected more from the nose and my initial sips had me wondering about the hype.  But as it hit a more proper temperature there were some lovely nuances I started to notice.  The interplay of malt and bitterness in the middle is fun.  I also expected it to be more bitter overall but I liked the malt component of this beer. 1

Smell:  A bright and citrus smell with some hints of pine. Taste:  Bitter but without bite if that makes any sense. Pine and grapefruit on the tongue.  Finishes dry..

Pours a golden orange with a half finger of head. Hops dominate the smell notes of pine. Medium feel with plenty of carbonation. Taste is mostly hops notes of pine and citrus with a bitter finish. Compared to Pliny the Younger this is more bitter and harsh. Very good but I think there are other DIPAs that are competitive with this one now.

The bottles traveled a long ways to get here and I couldn't be more excited. Aroma of freshly cut citrus and pine needles bursts forth from beneath the cap. Orange gold pour with a frothy white cap that lingers. Taste is pine orange rind clementine grapefruit papaya over a biscuity malt. Not overly fruity or piney or resiny - just perfectly balanced. The 8% ABV is hidden until there's a bit of warmth at the end of the sip. A real gem.

From the very first time I had this beer I knew it was something special yet so austere and seemingly "simple" that it really does exceed the sum of its parts. Here is potentially the single best double IPA in the world. A consistent sublime experience captured in a pint glass to be savored and enjoyed. A sincere thank you to my buddy Joe who bestowed a bottle of this (dated 1/20/17) to me as a quid-pro-quo for shepherding him to and from Logan Airport so he could attend a homebrew release party my buddy and I threw last weekend. Your attendance and contributions are appreciated!  Pours a beautiful clear golden color with a tight simple and hugely-retentive head of bone-white foam that laces extremely consistently and never relents throughout the whole pour. Carbonation rises steadily in small streams up from the bottom of my glass and each new pour re-rouses the head with an intense vigor. Pouring the entire bottle in yields a slight bit of haze. What a gorgeous IPA!  The nose is bright and citrus-forward; surprisingly playful and fanciful with a slight papaya note along with some hay and pine resin. Simple evocative devoid of trends... PtE is an exercise in perfect balance and execution and the nose is no exception by any means. Slightly grassy and even a bit earthy with some juicy tangerine and clementine in there as well. I'm also getting a bit of green onion which I know is a note that a lot of people have an issue with but which I find to be a surprisingly great element that contrasts well with the citrus peel and fleshy fruity notes here.  Flavor is of course heavily bitter and reliant on pine and grapefruit to nail down the palate though the subtle workings of biscuity bready malt and the even-handed juicy/tropical aspects really bring the whole thing home. The flavor is probably where the concept of "balance" that PtE stands for comes across the best I feel. The initial flavor is shockingly bitter with grapefruit peel melding instantly with clean golden malt just in time for the piney and tangerine-like back. Finishes dry... really dry actually with a lingering oily fruity note.  Feel is slick and palate-coating with a tempered carbonation and medium body that belies its 8% strength. Ethanol is mildly present but not at all overabundant or intense. In my opinion 8 to 8.5% is probably the best DIPA alcohol range and this represents the best-of-the-best of the lower-ABV DIPAs. If you haven't had this you're missing out. A simply amazing balanced drink. Makes a mockery out of many lower-caliber IPAs. Worth getting by (nearly) any means possible. 2

L: Clear light coppery yellow.  Two finger white head with great retention.  Sticky lacing.    S: Pineapple pine grass light toasted malt biscuit mint.    T: Grassy/earthen hops citrus and pine make their presence known as well.  Toasted biscuit malts.  Perfectly balanced and complex.  Absolutely delicious.    F: Medium body very crisp and refreshing.    O: Well known as one of the most prestigious beers of all time and it more than lives up to its reputation.  Update: Same bottle bottled on March 29th so less than a month old.    L: Same  S: Adding Grapefruit.    T: Grapefruit added here as well.  Man this is so delicious.    F: Nothing to add.    O: Still blown away.

In an age where there's so much craft beer out there that it all tries to be crazy and unique this one just hits all the marks with out trying. I tried to put myself back in time as well to when there weren't a billion IPAs on the market and yeah this would have blown my mind. Simply put I think this set the standard for a reason but people are out there now successfully making beer just about as good. Not knocking this beer at all but if you're waiting for a beer to change your entire life that's not what Pliny is doing (in my opinion). Nice yellow color quite a bit brighter than a lot of IPAs out there. The pine in the nose is 90% of what comes through. Mild carbonation and just a ton of hops in the aftertaste. This is good drinking and beer as it should be.

Brew date 1/13/2017 so pretty fresh!  I'd first drank this 7-8 years ago... a friend at a liquor store turned me onto this...at the time I could buy as much as I wanted!  (Think it was $4.99 then maybe even $3.99).  Even then before I even knew what an IPA was I found them too hoppy and bitter.  However scarcity and an open mind makes me try it when I do see it retail.  I prefer lagers wheat beer and belgian ales...more malt than hop so these double IPAs don't do much for me.  Really too strong and powerful to enjoy though this is more balanced and clean than many.  Had a Far Out IPA on tap the other day that I enjoyed much more...  My advice:  ignore the ratings and hype and trust your own taste buds.  They're the only ones that matter!

A: a clear and very clean amber color. Around 1-2 fingers of head and tons of lacing left as it faded.   A: The pine definitely dominant with a little grapefruit and a hint of some type of spice.   T: Multiple tastes in this one. An interesting flavor to start and then the pine really shows up. As I pause in between drinks I get a little more of the grapefruit and a little spice.   F: Hops and more hops with some bitter pine rounding it out.   O: A fantastic beer with an amazing hoppy taste. Left me wanting another one or two. Definitely hit the mark and lives up to hype. I really want to try the Younger version to compare.

Two nearly three fingers of firm fluffy solid slightly off white foam provides a confident lacing that remains consistently about an inch high in design thoroughly across the glass.  Nose provides an equal portion of malt and hops invasion that results in slight pepper a little bubble gum mango muted pine and a hint of vegetable earthiness.  Taste is equally satisfying but departs from any sweetness that was in the nose while maintaining a solid attack of  pine bitterness and alcohol bite that I was missing from drinking all the New style IPAs lately.  With this one I can almost taste what went on to influence so many west coast IPAs I've come to enjoy.  It truly is the"Elder".

S:  Glorious hops... pine resin citrus and some herbal character.  T/F:  Strong but light malts some bready flavors and a ridiculously complex and delicious bitter hop kick in the ass.  Strong pine and herbal notes with lighter citrus and grapefruit.  Peppercorn... slightly floral... smooth and oily on the tongue.  Sticky in the aftertaste.  Medium in body.  Grapefruit on the aftertaste.  O:  A classic and a 'whale' for a reason.  Just an all-around outstanding beer and huge thanks to DEK196 for the hookup.  One to savor and enjoy... and damn do I wish this had even occasional availability on the East Coast.

We found it on tap at Toronado (great beer bar) and I was expecting something earth shattering but for me the hype did not live up to reality. That's not to say I don't like it but I was expecting more.

Smells bready and doughy with loads of bright tropical fruit and citrusy notes of passionfruit guava mango peach papaya grapefruit orange peel with floral earthy herbal grass and dank resinous pine. Tastes like passionfruit guava mango peach papaya grapefruit orange peel some bready malts with bitter floral earthy herbal grass and dank resinous pine. Feels medium bodied creamy and smooth with moderate low carbonation. Overall a real great and classic DIPA.

This is probably the beer that will turn any beer snob snob into a beer snob (apologies not really a fan of "beer snob" as a term but it sounds quite poetic).   The thing is I only had it twice but it still remember it vividly. Among IPAs it is by far one of the easiest to drink. The perfect analogy is Jennifer Lawrence wearing a dominatrix costume. Its powerful fragrant hoppy amazing complex but it light and unbelievably easy to drink lulling you to a state of wanting to drink it over and over (of course responsibly)  After drinking a huge array of IPAs you realize that complexity and power are different things and most IPAs confuse overly powerful flavors with complexity and general deliciousness. This is one of few that manages to pull it off  Apologies it sounds ranty just finished a bottle :D

A creamy effervescent mouth feel a malty bitterness with citrus mingling and that same hint of honey emerging on the finish. As it warms more is emerging. This seems like a simple beer at first but don't be fooled. There are subltle complexities here that need to be studied. That would explain the long run Pliny has enjoyed.

Aroma - Pine grapefruit orange peel pineapple and hint of mango. The aroma is very balanced between the tropical fruit and pine.  Taste - Wow super smooth more of the pine and hops come out in the flavor than in the aroma still getting the grapefruit and orange/mango. It is hard to believe this is 8%.  Feel - medium body nice hoppy bite good carbonation slightly bitter.  Overall - This has been a huge want for me for some time and it lives up to the hype. Amazing flavors and so smooth.

The process I went through to get this beer was insane.  I drove from Easton PA to Denver CO just to get it.  I mean I did continue on to Boise to move in my brother but the beer was the highlight of my trip.

Appearance: Light amber body clear and filtered.  About a 1/2 fingers worth of head which dissipated over a couple of minutes and leaves plenty of islands of lacing in the glass.  Aroma:  Pine grapefruit pineapple and spice.  Taste:  Starts out with a tea like flavor which slowly fades into spicy pine and grapefruit and a mild tropical fruitiness.    Mouthfeel: Full on hops right away and a nice lingering pine bitter-tang.  Overall:  Oh yeah!  Lives up to the hype!  Curious to see any differences this might have if it was super fresh because this one is tasty!  The aroma seems a little muted to me but the taste more than makes up for it!

Smell is pretty hoppy. nice sweet malt backbone. Pine and grapefruit hop notes are good. Grapefruit notes are slightly stronger. Sweeter nose.  Taste is the same but more bitter and with a pine finish.  Heavy body. Tingling carbonation. Dry finish.  Very good. Worth the trip.

Not really... but it's up there and any beer lover should try it and should also try Blind Pig and Consecration and pretty much anything else that strikes your fancy at Russian River.  So Pliny deserves the hype but hype is still hype.

Aroma grapefruit and sappy grassy. Taste- medium bitterness at the end first off. Lingers long after the swallow. Grapefruit piney. Bit of alcohol in there. Not sweet. Mouthfeel is pretty soft. Overall this is a classic bitter DIPA. Bit too bitter for what I'd prefer most of the time.

Upon opening the bottle aromas of grapefruit and pine explode but the fruitiness tends to fade as you drink. Has the perfect balance that a well-made west coast IPA ought to; citrus resin malt and no detectable alcohol on the palate. This beer races over the tongue with a medium body. Delightful.

The clarity of the beer the crispness of the taste it's clean and unmuddled. It's complex but simple. I'm glad I have 2 more bottles.  This has been on my "must try list" since I first heard about it. I have no idea how long ago that was but I know the beer was legendary and I've heard about it a long time ago (it is now Oct 2016).  The bottle I had was 1 month old when I tasted it though it was in my possession for almost 2 weeks (I had been sick and taste buds shot so waited to have it figuring the trade off between being able to taste and extra aging was valid). Three bottles and a few other beers were shipped to MA from CA via a trade for Tree House and other beers local to MA. It was out of refrigeration for a little under a week.  There was  a lot of build up for this beer. I shared it with a good friend.  L: crystal clear straw colored. The current craze is cloudy/unfiltered so this was a nice change of pace. This was as clear as any pilsner. It looked delicious.  S: Clean refined quality. I don't know how else to describe it. These days saying it smelled piny a hint of citrus and some brown sugar is so typical for a DIPA it's become cliche. The smell was not muddled or complex. It's straightforward and just what a DIPA should seell like. I can only imagine that 16 or so years ago when this smell was relatively new to the beer scene that people went crazy.   Before I tasted it I reminded myself to be objective. I wanted to taste this beer and compare it to itself not to other beers. This beer has been around a while it's a flagship beer of Russian River and I wanted to put myself back in time to when this beer could not be compared to anything else.  T: After having a gazillion fruity hop-bombs on the East coast NEIPAs they're called I was hoping for a good honest beer. No tricks or gimmicks such as excessive cloudiness hop blasting etc. This was spot on what I had thought and hoped it would taste like. It fits the cliche for DIPAs perfectly: it has a huge amount of hop bitterness (piney grapefruit pineapple) that is supported by a strong malt backbone. There's some sweetness almost honey-like. It's piny some hint of citrus but the taste is clean and crisp and incredibly balanced. I think that's why I say it's quality. It's not aggressive or in your face in any way. It's frigging refreshingly easy to drink. I had guessed right that it's 8% but it didn't taste like it. A more significant observation is that the flavor didn't linger. It didn't fall flat but it faded quickly and made me to want another drink sooner that other big hop bombs do.  F: It was thinner than I thought it would be. This made the taste fade relatively quickly. I almost gave "Feel" a 5 because back when Pliny was first made this beer would have been considered full bodied. However even back then I'm sure I would have thought it faded quickly due to a thin mouthfeel.  O: This is hands-down one of the best DIPAs I've had in a long time. 3

Oak. Must.  T:  (Biased New Englander) Excellent beer but compared to... Thin and piney. That being said each sip gets better and better. The alcohol heat not as well balanced. Too much bitterness for the malt.  Lack richness of the best of Alchemy Hill Farmstead and Trillium.

(But it took the most iconic if not your Holy Grail to help me see your light.) Of course living in the Midwest... I never expected to taste this. But coincidence had me in San Francisco's City Beer store and after they diligently went through my "1001" list told me that Pliny The Elder would be there at noon in two days. I showed up at the appointed time and bought three. I took one to a party that no one drank beer (lucky me again.)  I took the two remainders home with one going to another party and found a fast way to make friends. (I may keep the last one to trade on BA but I may also hog it myself this week... lucky me.)  Never has alcohol been concealed so well in a bitter beer... and never has the bitterness been so aromatic in my nose and so light on the tongue.  Pliny will not convert me into the hophead ideology but he has made me appreciate fully what I never thought I could. 1

Poured into a pint glass pours a straw golden yellow with a 1.5 finger white foam head. Good lacing. Smell is of grapefruit melon pine and an almost bubblegum. taste is much of the same mostly grapefruit the bubble gum comes through more in the taste pine and a bit of melon. Mouth feel is typical of the style not too thick like other DIPAS I've had though. Honestly it tasted a lot like Lunch by Maine Beer Company. Definitely a difference between west coast and east coast DIPAS though. Overall a great beer and one I would go through lengths to drink again but I wouldn't put it above a few New England DIPAS. Overall 4.5/5.

Pours an Amber gold with a finger thick white head that's whipped creamy and won't die. Aroma is huge grapefruit notes of honey pine citrus and faintly yeasty. Flavor is bitter hops pine notes of citrus and a long smooth bitterness. The mouth feel is medium bodied and creamy incredibly smooth going down. It's so round and lively fresh off the tap and worth the trip out here.

Being on the east coast this is not available to me regularly so it was up to a trade to make it happen.  Sent a mix of Treehouse and Alchemist brews for my first Pliny.    It is everything other people have said.   It is a fantastic beer and a must to check off any ones list.   But if you are lucky to be near Alchemist and Tree House for example this is a different brew all together.   Extremely good and worthy of its 100 rating for sure.   The fact I prefer Treehouse or Alchemist over this RR brew doesn't mean it is any less spectacular.

Topped with 2 fingers of yellow tinged white foamy head.  Tropical fruits peaches and battery acid pine pineapple and sweetness.  Wow.  Now I have tasted Pliny.  What is most outstanding from the first sip is how smooth rounded and refined the flavours are.  I get the notes of pine and tropical fruits.  I get clean linen as well.  A fair amount of bitterness too.  Really hides the ABV.  Feels like a medium to light body with a little to moderate fine bubbled carbonation.  So smooth its incredible.  The hype yes and now I finally get to give my own opinion.  I went to Russian River in Santa Rosa CA today and picked up 6 bottles of this legend. Now Sept 15th I am finally drinking it.  I could smell it from the moment I opened the bottle.  The flavours are not as intense as I was expecting but the mouth feel is smooth beyond any brew for the 8% ABV I can remember.  Drinking in Santa Rosa tonight.  Bottled on Sept 6th 9 days ago. 1

A celebration worthy only of a true legend and a fresh sample at that: not even a month since the bottled on date. Props to my man out in Nebraska who hooked me up with a trade to bring this to my glass at last.  How does one analyze assess judge rate and/or compare a legend with anything close to objectivity? The answer is it's not possible. Not knowingly. If I'd had blind tasted this brew or (miraculously) hadn't heard of it before then my lens would be more pure without the weight of so much hype. It's like meeting a celebrity and realizing they are just a person like you: fallible imperfect a mere mortal. So it is here.  A: Pours a beautiful amber with an impressive head into my tulip glass. Foam has a nice fine texture has that oozey whipped cream like character that some brews have rather than sudsy.   S: The nose is fresh very clean very sharp and hoppy but much more subdued than expected. Grapefruit and orange zesty. A bit of pine but no at all resinous. Not getting much fruitiness otherwise. Not even a hint of alcohol or ester.  T: Pliney hits my palate with a flurry of small jabs bobbing and weaving working on me like some kung fu jujitsu ninja type shit. Not hooks no upper cuts not finishing move. Waiting for the haymaker that never comes I realize my expectations are shaping my experience. This beer is subtle. Hoppy yes. Firm and gripping bitter notes are present from the start to end of a quite long finish. Pithy but not biting. Grapefruit and orange in the citrus profile some herbaceous and grassy notes but it's all well blended and none of it is in-your-face as I've come to expect from DIPAs today. Malts are even more of a shock... this isn't very malty at all just enough to hold things together. Light but I wouldn't call it juicy. Delicious and doesn't leave me with palate fatigue but a surprise. Alcohol is entirely invisible (and at 8%). Very balanced.  M: VERY light bodied for the style which can often be syrupy with malts to balance out an overwhelming hop character. This take is opposite of that: a DIPA that drinks like a session IPA. Refreshing and paired well with some shredded pork lettuce wraps as a nice palate cleanser.  O: Legends rarely live up to their reputations. How can they? They can only ever be the shadows of titans. It's more complicated taking timelines into context.   The craft beer scene and the IPA scene in particular has evolved so much in the last several years. Second and third wave interpretations (maybe more or less than that I'm certainly not an expert there!) have moved the bar ever higher making really really good IPAs easy to get in all corners of the country. With Pliny being so difficult to come by due to such limited supply and such high demand especially for someone like me on the East Coast is it all worth it and does that figure into my feelings on the beer?   Every local or regional brewery has a flagship IPA as one of their first releases these days and they've all gotten respectable and some down right amazing. Other once sought-after craft labels have gone national and are easy to come by now. Is this really that much better than a Sculpin or a Hop Stoopid or a Dogfish 90 Minute? Perhaps that's not the right question because "better" implies we are comparing like with like. Or for that matter what about other "grail" beers that are hard to come by and legendary in their own rights? Heady Topper Zombie Dust (an APA not a DIPA but still) Jai Alai... those are just some of the ones from my personal hads list that come to mind. Is Pliny worthy of having and holding its number 1 status without risk of it being called "overrated"? (I'm tempted to make an analogy to the way Twilight Struggle held the number 1 spot on Board Game Geek for so long but that would go over the heads of non-boardgamers).   But IPA's aside from better on average and utterly ubiquitous have also migrated toward ever bigger ever bolder beasts of beers over the years and in several different flavor directions for that matter. The quest for more and more IBU's fresher and more diverse hops the use of hop oils hop rocketing at the tap. There have been shifts toward the piney and sappy the fruity and juicy the citrus bomb or toward more exotic fruit notes or herbal forward takes. With all of that Piny remains perhaps the best example of the ultimate zen that this style can achieve and that is only ever found in balance. Pliny is all about balance and is more of a beaujolaise than a cab sauv. I don't know if I've ever had a double IPA where the word DELICATE came to mind as a good summary description.  Past future present... hype meets reality... This is a damn good beer all the same. An amazing IPA that if no longer undisputed king deserves continued respect and admiration and most of all enjoyment. 4

Very inviting.  Smell - Mostly hops and pine very clear you know what you are smelling.  Taste - Hoppy piney resinous... has a great lingering flavor of pine and some malt.  On the bitter side.  Not a lot of lemon or fruit flavor just a straight up IPA.  Feel - Smooth medium body bubbly in appearance but surprisingly low in carbonation.   Overall - Worth the hype not crazy like the newer NE IPA's but a straightforward classic style IPA.

The OG of DIPAs and one that really drinks old-school too. Gone are the trends of today with the excessive haze sweet malts and tropical hop notes and in are the flavors of years past. Nice caramel malt backbone that carries the hops and allows them to shine in numerous ways- on the forefront of the palate is a quick blast of pine and resin which mellows out into a grapefruit-like bitterness on the back end. Really excellent beer and one I was pleased to see didn't shy away from bitterness. Never change.

The body is a slightly hazy golden yellow with a one and a half finger white head. Aromas consist of strong orange peel and grapefruit resin pinapple and mild spiciness. Flavors consist of the same and is very citrus forward. The bitterness is much less than expected and goes with the dry lingering finish. The feel is smooth with medium carbonation and is medium bodied.

Smell : See below but the malt is less apparent.   Taste : Orange cream pine resin undistinguishable malt. Pretty earthy.  Feel : Medium body and carbonation mild upfront hop bitterness which lingers in the finish.

Sits in the glass a transparent golden straw with little carbonation bubbles. Nice puffy head of medium and big soapy bubbles sticks around leaving thick lacing on the glass.  S: Major notes of grapefruit pith and dank floral earth. Light very slightly sweet malt in the background but overwhelming bitter citrus and resin.  T: Follows the nose. Citrus dominates up front--lightly sweet grapefruit pith and lemon juice. Excellent mid-mouth balance provided by a lightly sweet crackery malt presence. Pine and spruce round out the taste providing a lingering bitterness on that coats the sides of the mouth.   M: Archetypically west coast in feel it's ultra potent in its up-front delivery of the hops and unforgiving throughout the taste providing continuous waves of intense flavors. Medium feel is slightly creamy but nowhere near the level of its east coast counterparts. The overwhelming bitterness on the finish stings the back of the mouth long after each sip.  O: Revisiting Pliny for the first time since I began exploring the hazier 'NE-style' IPAs Pliny certainly continues to hold its own. While it doesn't possess the fruitiness or creaminess that I've come to expect of similar world-class IPAs it's not attempting to do so. Instead it maximally delivers all of the floral earthy and bitter citrusy aromas/flavors its hops have to offer as best as anything else out there. For the style it reigns supreme in my book. 1

Pours Golden with a robust head. Smell is pine and citrus.  Taste follows piney resiny grapefruity with intense bitterness.  Relative to that bitterness and the abv a pretty low malt profile.  Much more about the bitter than the sweet.  Love that.  Reminds me of why this one is a classic.  Terrific mouthfeel too--balanced with moderate totally apt carbonation.  Some will now prefer the Dank NE hop bombs some won't but everyone should see that what this tries to do it does flawlessly.

This was dated 6/1 and I wanted to get to it while it was still fresh which was thankfully the case!  The pour to this looked just like it did in the image up above - amber luminescent and full of a head that just never quit. It stayed throughout my session and stuck around on the side of my pint glass as the fullest and soapiest lacing that I've seen in quite a long time. Pine resin grapefruit citrus pith and alcohol were all in the nose with even more in the taste. Unbelievably smooth for something this strong to the point where there was no overt hop burn to be detected. The mouthfeel was that of a strong herbal minty hoppiness with lots of resin underneath as that stuck around on my teeth long after each sip went down. Truly a "West Coast" beer from start to finish!   The alcohol was here but with a frest-cut grassy feeling and enough of a malty presence to give this body you'd never realize that this even had any potency to it. So easy to see why this was on every "must-try" list that I've come across over the years - just like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale this was the gold standard for it's respective style. Find this however you can and for heaven's sake drink it fresh! 1

Smell is piney with a little sweetness. taste is piney resinous hops with some malty sweetness really none of the tropical IPA flavours that are very popular (and delicious) at the moment more of the classic american IPA flavours. it feels good real good. Overall a great beer and what i consider to be a nearly perfect example of this style. I got no off flavours and perfect balance from this one.

For my first ever review on this site I've lucked out pretty hard.  I will safely say that damn near every rumor you've heard about this guy is true.  Not for the meek of heart Pliny really is the stuff of bitter bitter monstrous legend.  Smells like a grove of Juniper and Ponderosa tastes like you dove headlong tongue-out into that grove.  Pick the needles out of your teeth sit back and enjoy what Russian River hath wrought.

Slightly hazy amber gold with a frothy head of white foam and rings of light lace. Pine needles and grapefruit zest dominate aroma and taste while still restrained. Biscuit malt rounds out a lean and balanced body with a clean bitter finish. Medium body and carbonation. Perfectly balanced.

908,/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.49,look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5,BigGold,First had poured from 17.25-oz. bottle label stamped bottled on "051616" gift from friend who visited brewery into nonic pint.  A bit late to my first Pliny this now-traditional DIPA does not assault any of your senses as do many newer IPAs but rewards slow contemplation. 
909,/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.46,look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5,Harrison8,Pours a very near clear (slight haze/cloud to it) yellow with a foamy 2cm white head. Head formation is nice and bubbly with solid retention and lacing left behind. Aroma is bolstering with hops. Specifically it has a piney herbal and sticky resin quality to it. The hop aromas are kept at a volume around 7 out of 10 in other words solid but not over powering. Taste is very much smooth pine hop qualities with herbal and resin hop notes adding to the character. Pliny the Elder is a bit on the bitter side but nothing overwhelming. It is well balanced and well executed - the best part of this beer. Mouth feel is bubbly with a slight abrasive quality in an otherwise velvety texture. It feels filling with a medium-thick consistency. Overall it is a fantastic beer that does hops justice. It is worth noting that this beer is incredibly hyped and while it is good it isn't a case of the mind-blowing Master Exploder Tenacious D scenario.  Served in a 12oz snifter.

That said IPA  hop profiles have moved along and in a good way. Pliny will always be a special beer and hopefully will continue in production forever.  Let's be thankful Russian River created such an iconic brew and one we will continue to build from.

Appearance 4.0: Pours out a very attractive deep golden hue.  OK head (1/4") and decent lacing.  No particulate matter; completely clear.  Smell 4.75: Really fantastic bouquet!  Pineapple Upside Down Cake immediately comes to mind followed by a deep malty hoppiness.  Very very promising.  Taste 5.0: Front is somewhat dry and stays in the front of the palate.  Almost a "dusty" flavor of hop alkaline bitterness.  Very nice.  Middle is like an explosion of hoppiness (hence the name of the beer; Pliny the E. died during the famed Vesuvius eruption) with well-balanced maltiness seeping in from the top of the palate.  Still this level is somewhat dry which is remarkable given this beer's ABV.  Finish is silky smooth and hoppy with a very very pleasant hint of alkaline hoppiness and a slightly sweet hint of sweetness floating around.  Also a warmness in the mouth at this level which indicates the high ABV.  No "booziness" though.  Aftertaste is long and lovely: smooth malty with a slightly piney hop hint.  Mouthfeel 4.75: Excellent level of conditioning for this style.  Not an area where this legend lets you down.  Overall 4.75: Excellent and easily understandable as to why it is a legend and why it inspired its own parade of copies.  What a genius blending of hops and hop additions.  This beer is BIG...8% ABV will knock you out if you aren't watching and can really sneak up on you because Pliny does not have any hint of booze whatsoever.  Experienced tasters may feel a slight warmness which indicates that this brew will kick you in the keister but other than that the focus is on the amazing hop blend.  Expertly crafted at every level Pliny is worth tracking down.  Thanks again Nancy! 1

It is a medium amber color with a one finger white head. The head is creamy and frothy with a decent amount of lacing on the glass. A good amount of carbonation bubbles are visible in the glass.   The nose is rich grapefruit pine lemons floral caramel toasted bread and  yeast notes.  A very strong grapefruit pine resin lemons floral perfume caramel toasted bread  and yeast.  M: carbonation slightly astringent and finish crisp.   O: A very hoppy beer with a strong malt back bone. Good beer glad I finally got to drink it.

It was slightly harsher and skunked than I expected.  Yes it has the nice citrusy and IPA'y goodness that we expected but nothing out of worldly.  I would rather have something by Knee Deep.  However one caveat.  I've found that more than any other beer IPAs are dependent on their freshness and very greatly.  I have previously sworn that other IPAs were great and than tried them later and not had the same response.  It's possible the offering I had did. It do it justice.  Yet I was not impressed.  This was just another IPa to me.

Lots of hops lots of malt in the nose with some pine. Hop forward flavor obviously. Pine and citrus really shine through. Fairly well balanced.  Mostly lives up to the hype but falls short of some of the great east coast DIPAs in my humble opinion. (Fiancé does not believe it lived up to the hype.)

S: Hops more hops pine. T: Similar to the smell a hop bomb. More juiciness and citrus coming through on taste. F: Heavy buzz going on second pint. Happiness of finding this brew and having on tap in the great city of SF is a real thing. O: A true winner. In a way I think this is hard to distinguish from a number of the IPAs it's inspired. The hype is justified though. So happy to have notched this one.

A: Pours a clear golden-amber color. A one-inch foamy off-white head with fair retention. Small amounts of thicker white lacing.  S: Aromas consist mostly of hops and citrus notes. Some pine floral and sweet malt undertones.  T: Taste matches the aromas well. The hops are definitely front and center here accompanied by some milder citrus notes as well. Nice strong hoppy bitterness with grapefruit orange and sweet malt flavors as well. Very well balanced.  F: Light to medium bodied. Smooth with good carbonation.  O: Overall this is a great DIPA. Happy I was able to trade for this and get to try it finally. Would love to try it fresher or straight from the source. Great showcase of a hop bomb though I think I was expecting a little more with all the hype surrounding this one but still an awesome beer!

L - Pours a clear golden color. One finger head nice lacing.  S - Knock your socks off aroma. Pine citrus hops all together in an amazing blend.  T - Awesomely sublime.  Well balanced bitterness and malt with a strong hop presence but not over the top.  Some citrus presence also.  F - Smooth finish but can feel a little heavy.  O - Amazing DIPA!

Ale was served in 16oz pint glass deep yellow gold with an inch of white head.  Aroma was hopped of pine and citrus.  Taste was very smooth and balance for a double IPA of this strength.  I did not detect any alcohol in flavor.  Finished brisk and satisfying.  Wow this was a great experience.  I was expecting a hop bomb but this was a very drinkable flavorful smooth exhilarating ale!

A very dark golden and clear appearance a very attractive beer to look at. Smells a little piney a little hoppy even a little bready. Almost goes without saying since its reputation long precedes my review but it tastes very balanced. I'm not even the biggest DIPA fan but I could really get behind this. Pliny really shines with its feel; so crisp and smooth. Feels incredibly medium bodied and light for its ABV I love it. Overall I'm glad I've finally had one of these famous west coast beers I've heard so much about for so long.

Tasted opposite a sampling of Trillium in two sessions on a Sunday.  L: Absolutely clean amber like looking through colored glass. S: Smell was subdued not overly strong but also less than I expected. T: Taste was quite possibly the most balanced arrangement of hops and malt I've ever had. F: Little thinner than i'd like but to be expected with filtered IPA.  O: Balance is what sets this west coast IPA out and above the rest of the west coast styled IPA. Just extremely good no hop bomb no bitter end no disappointment. One of the best beers in the world for a reason.

Simply put -- see classic DIPA in the dictionary -- the edition before the overload of tropical smells and taste (not knocking those traits love them too). See it done to perfection - a ton of flavor delivered with plenty of balance. A real treat for an East Coast father on Father's Day.

Appearance is a very clear amber with a head that lingers.  Smell is a pleasant cedar scent. Some other floral smells along with candied orange. It's not the hammer and anvil like Trillium but it is super nice. I guess I should get my nose out of the glass and pour some in my mouth...  Taste starts out with a savory earthiness. (That's such a strange description but it's what I get.) There's sweetness but it's not sweet; there's bitterness but it's not bitter. The hopping is perfect but I'm not getting enough complexity beyond the earth tones – which are perfectly executed – to really drive the rating up. Cedar other smoked woods and non-sweet candied citrus are the predominant flavors. Don't get me wrong what's there is pretty damn good.  Feel is the smoothest and easiest to gulp that I've had. It's also has some weight to it. A little swishing around the mouth intensifies the flavors a bit without getting fizzy. Overall I'd say that it cannot be improved upon for me.  I have some bacon-wrapped shrimp on a cedar plank in my freezer and I'm going to have to cook those up to consume with my remaining bottle. Man some West Coast IPAs crank up the bitter but this one has exemplary balance making me actually really enjoy that gustatory sensation. 1

The body is balanced very well with malt sweetness and soft hop bitterness. Balance truly is the descriptor for Pliny the Elder and it finishes clean with a soft restrained bitterness.

Taste: Nice DIPA and balanced.    Feel: Medium and the hops lingered for a bit.  Fresh.  Overall: I've had this many times.  Better draft than bottled.  Too many people hunting bottles nowadays.  Draft is a lot easier to find.  A must try.  Long time user but 1st review.

This beer comes with a lot of hype and therefore a lot of expectation when someone who has been seeking it finally tries it.  For me it lives up to the hype.  Taste is an excellent balance of citrus fruity and pine.  Finish is excellent and leaves you wanting and able to have more.  Ends pretty cleanly without much bitterness.  Smell is almost better than the taste.  Aromatic clean and not heavy or overly piney/resinous.  Overall a beer worth seeking out an having for sure.

1040,/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.64,look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75,DaverCS,Picked up a case while at Russian River on a beer trip with my dad.   Pours a filtered golden-honey color with 1 finger of a well retaining head. Phenomenal lacing on the glass.   Aroma is primarily dominated by pine a bit of grapefruit a solid amount of malt sweetness and a kiss of citrus.   Taste is much more balanced than expected. There is a very prominent malt backbone that keeps the bitterness in line. I was expecting a hugely bitter hop bomb but this is balanced. Sure there is a solid kick of bitterness but it’s not overwhelming. There is a mild amount of carbonation with a creamy mouthfeel.  Taste is again very pine-forward and resinous. Some nice citrus notes come forth as do grapefruit peel.   My overall assessment is that the beer is very good. However the hype surrounding it is a bit insane. It’s a prime example of the class: no off flavors well-balanced and delicious. My only critiques is that the malt-backbone is a bit too much which does mute some of the hops and creates a bit too thick of a mouth-feel for my preference. I see this pairing well with Pliny and beer bites of course! It gets a 93/100. 1

Smell: very clean smelling brew with hops shining. I also get a nice citrus blend and floral. Very minimal caramel malt sweetness.   Taste: hoppy citrus a bit of stone fruit. You get a super amazing hop bit at the back in the finish and it smacks you right in the face. The subtle malts your get in the beer accentuate the sweetness you get from the fruity notes. The medium level bitterness can be compared to like an orange zest or orange pith type thing. This beers balance is spot on.  Mouthfeel: I pretty much this is the characteristic that has been setting this beer apart for me ever since I first had it back in the day. The mouthfeel is smooth and a little thin for an 8 percent but not in a bad way. In this scenario the light character of the beer gives it an insane drinkability and refreshing satisfying quality. After waves and waves of flavor pummel your palate the piney delicious hop oils coat your tongue with a beautiful aftertaste.  Overall: Even though I am not as amazed with this brew as I was my first couple tries I am super appreciative of the path its paved for so many breweries and recipes that followed. It's been around for forever and its quality hasnt seemed to diminish too much. A super fresh Pliny the Elder at just the right temperature still hits the spot and is a real treat. Whether in bottles or draft. 1

So it definitely didn't meet strict freshness standards. Totally delicious though. Color is paler than I expected. Smell is floral and inviting. Taste has a sweetness I didn't expect but works well ... reminiscent of how Belgian beers use sweetness to complement the booziness. But it doesn't come off as something decadent and rich like you would expect from an imperial IPA ... it's something that I want to drink a few of because they are so damn drinkable.

For a double ipa the new it seems like the new breed is taking over but this is still the classic. A: Light orange and hazy. Nice creamy almost white head of very small to moussy bubbles. S: Pine and citrus on the nose with a little biscuit/breadcrust T: The pine and citrus from the nose are a smooth punch to the tongue. I get no grain and medium bitterness on the back end. Bittering hops linger through aftertaste and bring you back wanting more. O: The classic example of a double ipa. Is it worth trading your first born? Not if you have other quality hop options in your back yard but every beer drinker needs a fresh pliny in their lifetime.

L- Much lighter color than any IPA I've had. Very light orange I can actually see through it. Thin white foam.   S- Very nice aroma. Piney citrus slightly dank.  T- Not a lot of bitterness. Mostly bready malt and dank. Slight orange notes. Much different than your usual hop-bomb IPA's.   F- Fairly heavy for an IPA solid carbonation.   O- It's a very good IPA that I would buy regularly if I could reliably get it in my area. However I'm not sure I'll go through the trouble of acquiring it again especially since it would likely be more than 3 weeks old.

Everyone knows about this beer so I'll just give my general impressions having had a lot of other west coast IPAs.   First don't come to Pliny expecting "tropical" or "juicy" new American or NZ hop profile; it's a more classic hip profile but a damn good one. I got a lot of Simcoe dankness on the nose which I'm a fan of. Hop flavor opens up to more citrus notes. Again no super-hype hop flavor citra bomb here just all the best of what classic west coast hop flavor should be. Also surprisingly not that bitter; we drank a growler of fresh Ruination 2.0 just before this and it was night and day with the Stone being much more bitter.   Next the thing that blew my mind about this and what I'm really taking away from my first Pliny is the malt character. Hops are important in an IPA but this has to be the most delicious malt flavor I've tasted in a long time. For an "epitome of the style" type of beer it doesn't seem like other brewers are nailing the Pliny balance the way they could be by this point in time. It's perfect; not sweet but present super uber clean with substantial mouthfeel like a good pale ale has. I guess "dry" is a word that gets tossed around IPA a lot and maybe the hops increased the perception of sweetness for me but it was not thin (which a lot of IPAs are) yet not heavy (which a lot of IPAs are). So clean.   Great beer. 1

I was a little surprised at the color it was more of a dull gold color than I'm used to seeing for IPAs. Overall it was very good maybe a little overhyped but definitely enjoyable. I would love to have it again.

It really adds to the spectrum for me however I did have it almost 2 months after bottling. But I had no choice they brought it to me from a case in the back. What was I going to say don't you have a fresher one? I felt it was take it or leave it and the choice was obvious. My mission will now be to drink it as fresh as possible to see how much stronger the hop bitterness and presence can be. maybe I will have it on tap next since it seems easier to get it that way here in the Southland

For starters it's a much lighter color than I'm used to with most dipas  which stands out as pretty unique. I like the look of its bubbles running up the sides of the glass. The smell is pretty standard. Can't pinpoint which hops are used but their presence is obvious a nice little malty "aftersmell" is present as well.  Tastes good good balance of sweet and bitter. I'm not much of a hophead but I would have preferred a stronger hop flavor than it has. But it's a solid taste I can see why people like it. It's got a clean light mouthfeel. Very drinkable so be careful drink it too fast and you'll remember it's 8%! Overall good brew. Did it blow my mind? No. Would I stand in line for hours to buy it? No. But it is good. I'd chalk it up to being a great intro if youre looking to get into the realm of DIPAs and I'd leave it at that.

Feel: medium mouthfeel some foaming action light refreshing fizzy carbonation Overall:  Definitely an IPA and it's understandable that this is the standard for an IPA.  Would get again if I had the chance and I'm not even a huge IPA guy.

Good white head forming 3/4" depth.  Awesome aroma of resinous mango guava tropical fruits tangerine and citrus.    Taste is excellent hop flavors along the lines of the aroma soft bitterness super cracker light toasted pale malts.  Drinks so easy.  Pine is in there too.  This was the first to pack lots of proprietary hops into a super dry light body but with a heavy abv you won't know about unless you read it or until you feel it.  The prototype.

Not just bubbly but frothy!  Great head retention!  A beautiful light golden/copper color that is crystal clear (clear enough to read fine print through).   Smell: The aroma is pretty powerful.  It is citrusy and very floral.  Slight tart smell and slightly fruity.  There is also a hint of caramel and malt.       Taste: There is a nice PUNCH of hops at first.  Very crisp and “bright” tasting.  The bitterness is pretty strong at first then it fades a bit to let the other flavors make their appearance but then it seems to come back.  During this gracious pause from the hops you get flavors of sweet caramel and a savory buttery flavor.  There is also a nice roasted woodsy / earthy flavor as it starts to trail off.  As the other flavors and hop bitterness fade you are left with nice citrus and a slight charred wood after taste.      Feel: Upper light to low medium mouthfeel.  Doesn’t feel this as it stays quite bubbly the whole time in the glass.  It does feel quite slick (probably form the larger amounts of hop oils).         Overall: Great!  Not sure about this being the perfect beer though.  It is balanced quite well -some more sweetness would be ok though.  All of my favorite hop flavors are in this one.  This brew never lost its fizz and never a gap or hole in the foam.  This was earthier than I expected.  It definitely got better tasting after it warmed a bit. 1

After two years of regular consumption I have found it to be a bit sweet for my changing taste buds but compared to off- the-shelf doubles it still reigns superior.   A: Golden with a thick creamy head  S: Citrus and pine  T: Sweet and smooth  M: excellent slightly thick and a bit of lingering sweetness on the finish  Overall one of my favorite beers but I would highly urge any IPA lover to try Blind Pig at the RR brewery.

So it's as fresh as I can possibly get it since we don't get it in my area.   The pour is magnificent with mango-apricot glows highlighted by pale edges as its light struck. Slight haze 10% opacity. Head is huge 3 fingers and develops a reverse bowl in the middle.   Aroma is...holy smokes. Perfect combination of pine and fruits. Uhhhh...mazing? It's got herbal notes spicy notes as well as the trademark freshly peeled orange cored pineapple and pine needles. Touches of raw avocado sushi style. As the head recedes onion and dank resins come out that slightly distort the pure aromas here.   Taste? Wow. Pliny is neither overwhelming nor plain. I was expecting a palate buster but that's not the case. It scrubs the tongue slightly with a bit of oils and resins but for the most part it stays very tropical with a hefty dose of malty biscuit notes. Mango papaya melon cantaloupe orange pineapple...then the resins come in to dirty it up just a touch. Finish is dirty pine dried mango and hop resins.   Feel is thick juicy and enough carbonation to let it slide down easily and make it pleasurable.   Pliny is one HELL of a beer. It's no wonder it scores a 100 out of 100 on BA. It's a fine choice and makes it easy for me to finish the whole thing. Might as well say it - the best DIPA on the planet. 1

Dated 2-12-16 almost 2 months old. Hoping this doesn't affect the quality knowing fresh fresh is always way better. But took my chances anyway.  Pour is an almost-opaque golden/copper. Pretty clear without much haze to it. Foamy two finger thick head that doesn't dissipate very quickly. Moderate lacing.   Smell is more citrus and pine foward than anything. Almost an earthy and grassy smell. Very slight tropical flavors some mango and pineapple. But the fruitiness is very subtle. Pine tree bark and citrus pretty much dominates.  Taste is simple and effective. Very easily drinkable for a double IPA. No taste of alcohol just the perfect balance of the sweetness malts and hops. Quite possibly the most balanced IPA I've ever had. But is that a good thing? Depends on what you're looking for. Because nothing with Pliny really "stood out" as far as flavors go. Moderately piney moderately tropical nothing expiremental. But maybe that's a good thing.  Overall very well balanced and nothing over the top. Maybe I'm too spoiled by these big hoppy malty DIPA's. Or too spoiled by these NE-style juice bombs. But this is just right and in between of the two. I guess this is why it's so highly rated. Nothing expiremental but nothing too complex. Just right. 1

Orange pinepineapple and flowers. Taste is very bright with mango and other tropical fruits and pine balanced out by some earthy malt. Super flavorful. Moderate bitterness closes things off along with some alcohol. This is a really wonderful IPA very bright and drinkable. The 8% ABV is well hidden. Complex tasty and delicious.

Head retention is decent as is lacing.  The aroma is just awesome.  Big big juicy orange citrus and hoppy resin.  Big juicy citrus taste strong piney resin.  Everything you would hope for in an IPA.  It is very astringent at the end though.  Soapy aftertaste.  LIght bodied with moderate carbonation.  Drinks more like a regular IPA and not a DIPA though.  Been wanting to try this one for a long long time.  Parents went to Napa and shipped a couple of bottles back.

Given to me unexpectedly from Tony -- as if you haven't seen it enough thanks a ton! Obviously been high on my wants list since I started drinking craft beer. This is a big thing for me.  Appearance: Beautiful clear light amber color. There's a bright white head that dies down and leaves a shallow head on top with quite a bit of lacing. Plenty of carbonation coming from the laser etching at the bottom of my glass... seriously good looking IPA.  Smell: A little juicy but very piney and resinous. Nice sweet malt. Very "clean" on the nose. It doesn't show its alcohol at all. Really enjoying the pineapple and mango aromas as it opens up/warms up a bit.  Taste/feel: In terms of a DIPA I think it falls short of the best ones I've had only because it's a bit thin and light tasting -- but at the same time that's what impresses me about this beer. At 8% it drinks like 6% -- no alcohol light yet intense flavor and all-in-all delicious. This is such a stupidly well-balanced beer. There's a bitterness on the end that lingers a bit with a pine flavor but I love it: it has me constantly coming back for more. The feel as I alluded to is a bit light. It drinks a bit more like a regular IPA as it doesn't have a full feel... yet it doesn't bother me. It impresses me. The carbonation is perfect  I'm really trying to rate this as objectively as possible -- it's tough because my expectations have always been so high for this beer. I will say that it is absolutely fantastic but that it's not a total one-of-a-kind beer that needs to be traded for at all costs. The chances are if you've had one of the many world-class DIPAs out there you've tasted something similar to this.  Without a doubt though find this beer. There's so much history with it. Not only that the balance is perfect for the style (leaning a bit towards more bitter which I love) and it's so -- I know it's vague -- pure tasting that it's something every beer connoisseur ought to experience. 2

I am definitely more biased to east coast doubles but even in the blind test it didn't take me away.  I still saw blind big is one of the best beers I've ever had.  Younger was way better than this as well the hops weren't as dominant as I like but maybe that's a good thing for a double IPA.

Leaves behind lacing around the edge with a see-through film across the center. Little streams of bubbles continue to rise throughout the whole experience.   S: A ton of citrus hops with mangos oranges malt and a bright pine finish. Lots of sweet aromas that are tempered slightly by the hops and malt.  T: A lot more hops and malt especially upfront. Soft citrus and orange follows with a small twinge of bitterness that isn't overpowering and lingers nicely. Perfect balance of flavors!   F: Medium body but very light finish due to the carbonation. Very drinkable and compliments the taste very nicely.   O: I couldn't be happier with the flavor balancing. Very sweet on the nose but doesn't negatively affect the flavor and helps keep the bitterness under control without squashing it. Definitely lives up to the hype if you don't want/expect a bomb of hops.

Hazy pulpless orange juice looking with a very soapy looking frothy white one finger  head.  S - tons of citrus very tropical. Pretty sure this was fermented from a can of concentrate banana-orange-mango juice my poor family bought from the dollar store growing up.   T - extremely subdued and not what I was expecting. Very clean/crisp/bright but also much sweeter than I expected.  Zero alcohol. Very good extremely drinkable.   M - High carbonation but thin. Drinks like a light beer.  O - I have no complaints with this beer really. It's well rounded and very good. But there's nothing "WOW HOLY SHIT" about it. If this beer is a 100 then it's a 100/115.

Golden orange with a touch of haze. 1 finger head with nice sticky lacing.  S. Lovely mix of malts and hops. Lots of tropical fruits such as mango and orange mix with a touch of pine and sweetness.  T. Balance is near perfect. For 8% I don't receive a touch of alcohol. A nice blast of hops up front leads to a sweet and smooth with a bit of a pine bite on the finish.  F. I'd say it's just on the the lighter side of medium mouthfeel with average carbonation.

Clear beautiful pale golden malt. Smell is my only complaint. Beyond the Douglas fir and grapefruit pith I can smell that 8%. Not cool. Taste is subjective. Like I said this is the pinnacle of its style. I just happen to not care for it. The feel is a winner. Carbonation and body are on point.  Out of a 510ml bottle into Riedel Burgundy glass. Bottle stamped 2/12/16.

Clear golden look with a head that last.  Smells like a big citrus bomb and the taste delivers.  Nice residual sweetness at the end.  Only beer on my radar for my Napa trip.

Maybe someday I'll have a better IPA then the Ballast Point grapefruit Sculpin or the Russian River Brewery Pliny the Elder Double IPA. I would put Odell Mercenary Double IPA just a touch below this still great world class. Maybe in blind taste test I would pick the Odell? I think perhaps the only IPA that is well known that I have not tasted and is better then this would be Heady Topper and Pliny the Younger. Until that day this stuff and Ballast Points Grapefruit Sculpin are the best beers I have ever had the pleasure of imbibing. Cheers!

A - Wonderful clarity golden straw in color meandering carbonation supports a thin white cap. Again wonderful clarity. S - Tropical notes blend seamlessly with deciduous elements Striking in complexity sweet malts and a citrusy jam round out the nose. T - The balance throws me off balance! Malt extraction is near perfect the hop profile says expert craft on display. M - Full n body a bit slick on the palate a sweet linger with just enough bitterness to close the deal. O - There has been so much written and for good reason. This offering is to be treasured fresh as per directions on the label.

I decided to pop it the same night as another sought out beer that lived up to the hype - Zombie Dust.  This one sadly - did not.  Good beer but def not up to the hype.  I can think of 6 DIPA's that I prefer.  Again pretty tatsy brew but not worth searching out.  Just MO.

Its the double that you always want to drink but you can't always have it. (unless your really lucky) All i know is when I see a case of the Pliny I get it. Its probably the best double Ipa out there or its at least in the top 5 best doubles IPAs.

Honeycomb of thin lace with decent retention.  (4.25)	  S:	 Perfect balance of brightish malt and piney citrus.  Oranges pine cone potpourri bread caramelized sugar.  (4.5)	  T:	 Big thick wave of malty bitterness.  Citrus rind left to ferment in pine sap soap bitter orange slightly sweet white dough clover.  (4.5)	  M:	 Medium-full body with sticky resinous shellac lingering doughy warmth soft carbonation.  (4.5)	  O:	 Wow this is an excellent beer!   Really full of malt and sticky west coast hops.  Neither is never NOT there but the hops slowly creep to prominence in a wave of citrus pith to pine pitch that ends in a vageuly warm hoppy finish.  Dryish sweetish piney fruity malty hoppy.  Just a solidly great beer that hits a lot of highpoints.   Would actively seek this one out in the future.  (4.5)

The hops aren't overwhelming bitter once it warms up a bit gives a bit of citrus. Really smooth. Has distinct feel over say the NE hoppy beers. Very glad I got to try this out.

Strong papaya and citrus nose and those flavors definitely come through along with the creamy texture.  The sweet and hoppy bitterness is so balanced.  The carbonation is so fine it feels like cotton candy melting in your mouth.  No other beer gives me this sensation.  Although the Younger is so much bigger in every way this is just as bold and delicate.   I drink this everyday!  Love it!

Appearance: crystal clear golden orange with a thick slightly off white head. Nice lacing. Aroma: Strong fresh fruity melon and citrus with a bit of pine. Taste: Light malt sweetness with a touch of caramel turning to a strong juicy grassy resinous hop flavor. Only the lightest touch of citrus comes across. Bitterness slowly builds into strong crescendo. Mouthfeel: Light body for the style with a moderately high carbonation. Finish: Very dry with a strong grassy bitterness. Overall: Probably the easiest drinking most refreshing IIPA you’ll find. Lighter malt base than most but still balances the strong bitterness well.

It's the balance that makes this a great beer. The fact that it has a clean finish that puts it over the top for me.

Poured a golden color that shined through with a two finger white head. Smelled of glorious hops pine citrus and tropical fruit notes Taste - a nice crisp hoppy piney and citrus DIPA Medium carbonation with a nice mouthfeel  So pumped I'll be getting some more shipped to me!

They sell them one or two at a time.  Anyways PTE is the golden standard for West Coast IPAs. Russian River makes great double and triple IPAs.  It's some good shit.

Look: Beautiful honey golden color with a thick head. Pretty fine head with good retention and lacing.  Smell: Citrus. Citrus. Piny. Piny. Malt backbone can be felt as well. Again more citrus.  Taste: Resinous bitter grapefruit and orange rind flavors are very front and center. But it's so well balanced that other tastes begin to seep in. Excellent. I would say it's the perfect taste.  Feel: Medium body very smooth mouthfeel. I personally like less-carbonated beers but this was very nice too.

Bottled 12/24/15   Poured into a Lawson’s snifter. Clear golden orange color with two fingers of fluffy head leaves some nice lacing. Overall looks great I cant wait to try this stuff!!   Upon cracking the bottle its become clear that im in for a real treat. Dank earthy smell with some definite citrus character – getting what seems like orange and grapefruit rind as well as a pleasant hint of pine. Its not like a citrus bomb where you feel like your in a tropical paradise but hot dayummm the nose on this brew is appealing.  Citrus up front complimented by a subtle but definitely noticeable sweetish malt flavor. Finishes with a slightly sweet pine taste that sits really nicely on the tongue. Its  all about BALANCE achieved to perfection. Mouthfeel is on point.   It is hyped? Yes. It is a great beer? Yes. So who cares if its over hyped… or if its the best IPA in the world. This is all subjective of course. In addition no point to compare it to Heady or SOS… because its completely different which is great because variety is what keeps you guessing. To me this is an absolutely excellent beer ridiculously balanced and drinkable… amazingly refreshing and crisp. Would love to give this baby a try a few days after bottling! I would highly recommend this brew its nothing like Heady or SOS but that’s what makes it so great. 1

A beautiful color to the beer perfect carbonation and lacing.  Aroma of lemons stone fruit and grass. Taste was just awful. AWFUL. I can deal with IPA bitterness and know that this is a very hoppy beer but FUCK. It tasted like cigarette buttslemon juice and hay. Just nothing good to speak of. The finish was dry as shit with almost no flavor carry over except the cigarette butts. I've got to say it had decent body to it but nothing outstanding.

Its still a great beer it just can't compete with Surly TG or NE dipas. Tons of pine tons of resin tons of hop bitterness. Its a crisp dipa its just not a top dipa anymore

Look is a cloudy darker gold color with a nice 2 finger off white head.  Aroma is all hops with floral and pine notes.  Taste is bitterly hop forward with more pine grassy floral hints upfront with slight citrus flavors on the back end.  Great bitter bite that lingers on palate for minutes after drinking.  Mouthfeel was crisp with very good carbonation.  Overall this beer lives up to its stellar reputation.

Balance is what makes this so incredible - the citrus doesn't overwhelm the piney-ness and the bitterness doesn't overwhelm the sweetness. Amazingly crafted piece of work.

S: Grapefruit and some pine with a bit of delicate malt behind it. Good but the aroma could come on a bit stronger in my opinion.  T: Resinous bitter citrus rind flavors up front showing signs of classic puckering US C-variety hops.  As with the nose it displays some delicate pilsner-like malt that adds a bit of bready caramel particularly towards the back-end bringing this beer into the realm of the DIPA. Long bitter resinous finish balanced by that dense bready malt. An excellent classic IPA flavor profile the leans towards drinkability. I could – though definitely shouldn’t – drink this all day.  F: Medium body with smooth retrained carbonation and a slick silky mouthfeel. Just a hint of ethanol presence.  Overall: The OG of whalez it’s hard to overstate the status this beer has held within and without the craft beer community. Is it the be-all-end-all of DIPAs? Of course not – no beer is or ever should be. But it’s an excellent one and it is easy to see why it garnered the acclaim that it has within its historical context.  (Dope name too; I feel like pulling a random historical figure to name your beer after was pretty before its time when this first came out.) 1

Smell is amazing: citrus pine dank slight malt. Taste is crisp and clean but not as solid as the nose. Mouth is is great slightly sticky yet light.   An absolutely stellar IPA and steal for the money.

Very tropical and citric. I get orange grapefruit pear papaya sharp floral hops. The taste follows. Impressive. Creamy mouthfeel. Bitter but clean on the finish. Deservingly a classic.

The smell is clean and pleasant but not overwhelming. The aroma is hops and citrus. The taste is quite good but very mild citrus & pine flavors. I expected a bolder taste. It's well balanced but very mild. Very smooth and easy to drink but for all the hype I expected a bit more.

Citrus-y slightly earthy very resinous hops. The malt is hardly detectable in the nose. They could make an air freshener out of this beer!  Taste: This beer tastes like straight up tropical juice in a glass. Super bright flavor profile. The hops are certainly resinous and juicy but not in the least bit bitter! The flavor is just incredible!  Feel: Drinks as smooth as silk. Almost has a creamy characteristic to it. I could drink this all day.  Overall: This beer certainly lives up to the hype and maybe even exceeds it! I would prefer this to Stone Enjoy By Heady Topper or even Sip of Sunshine; it's that good! I will drink this beer whenever I see it on tap.

There is a little bit of bitterness/tartness after-taste is lemon iced tea.  F - effervescent medium body lighter than expected  O - hop party on the palate delicious very forward brew which lives up to its legacy as one of the ultimate representatives of the style.

I always heard of this as being the best IPA and got my hands on a 17.25 oz bottle. It lives up to the hype.  While the bitterness and dryness of it being an IPA makes the taste less appealing to me the carbonation is perfect the smell is pleasant and the beer looks beautiful.  Won't make me an IPA drinking but its an impressive brew.  Worth a try even if you aren't into IPAs I can believe it being a must have if you are a fan of the style.

Lots of great memories with this beer....in bottles with brother at GGF in Berkeley ...3000 miles removed with brother on-tap in Philly....RR in Santa Rosa...bottled 2 days old before buying on my B-Day.  I dunno...this beer has a lot of hype around it. Its really good (don't get me wrong) but not something I would try too hard to get. If you can taste it...great! If you can trade for it...nice! It is really good....but it isn't my end-all-be-all IPA.  Fresh is best!  I chose 2 pints of Row 2 Hill 56 Pale over this at RR on my B-day....

It's been a minute since I've danced with PtE; quite frankly I missed her. Intense aroma in the nose. Honey layered malt bill is prominent. Grapefruit rind and a bit of citrus too. New car scent pine aroma lingers. Smoked barley on the tongue amazingly. Ripe tobacco leaf a tinge of spearmint and over ripened grapefruit. Creamy on the front end semi-dry on the finish. Perfectly balanced. Pronounced head that lingers like the ex-girlfriend who won't move on. Beautiful. This is a master class in brewing. Cheers Vinnie.

Had this out of a fresh bottle alongside about 6 other 97+ rated ipas and dipas. This was not my favorite. I would have liked to have seen more cloudiness in the appearance but the head was nice and lingered. Smell fresh hops with some pine tint to it.  Honestly less of a bomb than some of the competition. It'd be a treat to drink this regularly but on this occasion I preferred green street all green everything and mosaic (ya I know different styles).

Wow so so smooth.  8% but barely a trace of alcohol on the nose or palate. hoppy but doesn’t carry the overwhelming bitterness that is expected with a 100 IBU beer. balanced and smooth. Worth the hype & wait.  Cheers

Bottled on 9/30. Good looking beer with nice somewhat subtle aroma. Great balance of bitter and sweet taste that lingers. Medium very enjoyable mouth feel. Probably impossible to live up to the hype but this is obviously a fantastic beer.  I thought about this all night. I know I'm crazy. This beer reminds me so much of a higher quality Lagunitas Sucks. Anyone else get this? It's better but all I could think was Sucks

The appearance was a hazy bronzed golden orange to amber color with a beautiful one finger white foamy lacing running around the glass. The smell started off with a sly bittersweet luscious pine rolling into a citrus rind-like and pulp-like hoppiness. An ever so slight grassiness wants to balance. The taste was moderately bittersweet take the citrus and the pine to hit each other like two freight trains colliding. I'm getting it all at once. There's the burst of the sweet and the burst of the bitter. Its all there. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a sly sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed to feel exactly right for a DIPA. There's enough bitterness as a DIPA and enough sweetness to cling to my tongue extremely nicely. Overall wow just wow just what an absolutely awesome DIPA coming in from California for an exceptionally nice trade. I know I would definitely have again.

There are just so many amazing IPAs out there now it's hard to say this was the best I've had. Definitely delicious and at the top of its game wouldn't hesitate to order it again.

I don't know if it's overhyped or if my pallet judges it unfairly because I have regular access to lawsons and have had other top east coast I.p.a.'s. I found the flavor to lack depth and I struggled to find any juicy hop flavors

Smell is just amazing every time. Awesome citrus and pine hop aroma. Taste is very smooth and balanced. Medium mouthfeel with medium bitterness. Lingering hop flavor. Low/medium carbonation. One of my favorite beers of all time and the ultimate West Coast DIPA.

The draught lace does not stand up  but this  an appealing beer. This is why to seek out Falling Rock Tap house in Denver because they always have it.

I enjoyed the hint of baking bread on the nose and the nice symmetry of sweetness on the front of my tongue and bitterness on the back of my tongue and roof of my mouth.  Properly carbonated with medium/medium-heavy mouthfeel and no unpleasant aftertaste.  Clear orangey-amber with dissipating white head that laced nicely on glass and lingered there.  Lovely beer to drink and ponder while I caught up on work today.

Aroma of pine grapefruit pineapple floral orange resin and malt. Flavors are all of the above with a bready/crackerlike note with a nice balancing malt character that balances the bitterness all the way through. Mouthfeel is med-med/low carbonation with a slick hop oil on the tongue.  Overall I cant find much wrong with this beer other than maybe a little more aroma.

Excellent clarity.  Masses of sticky lacing left behind.  Bright tropical aroma.  Pineapple and grapefruit.  Floral and piney hops notes prominent as well.  Just hints of cracker like malt.  Hop flavors are very smooth and balanced.  Grapefruit pine something floral.  Pineapple and orange.  Light malt cracker-y.  Some mild caramel as well.  Provides good balance.  Pine really comes through at the end.  Medium body with a very smooth mouth feel.  Medium carbonation.  Very well balanced.  Mild bitterness.  Hops linger tropical and piney.  A truly excellent IPA with amazing hop flavors that dance on the tongue.  Bold but balanced.  Drinks almost like a session IPA.

One per customer behind the counter $4.99 a bottle. I didn't even have to know a code word. This is just seriously a great IPA. Born on September 30 2015. A subtle understated nose and the first sip is like a west coast sunset. Pours a golden orange with a medium head that dissipates quickly and leaves behind a good amount of lacing. Taste is bitter pine all the way with a hint of fruit on the back end. Not too sweet and with a nice full mouthfeel. If I could get this fine beer all the time and price was no object I would drink it every week. Luckily I have to hunt for it which makes the finding and tasting that much better.

The white head wasn't very thick but it did leave quite a bit of lacing on the glass.  None of the aromas were overwhelming but pine citrus and floral were noticeable.  The taste carried many more pine and bitter notes than the smell would have suggested and the aftertaste was very clean and dry.  More hop forward than some the elite East Coast IPAs.  Alcohol wasn't apparent and the feel was a little fuller-bodied than a normal IPA.  Suggested food pairing: A grilled white fish maybe halibut  If you like this beer then you should also try: Head Hunter  Ideal time to drink this beer: This beer is so quintessentially West Coast Central/Northern California that I can't imagine it being better anywhere else.  Since that region is more commonly known for its wine production maybe you could have a Pliny after attending some wine-centered event.  It could wash the taste of condescending stuffiness from your mouth.  Overall: 4.25 (This beer is good and I would likely drink it again)  This is a good solid IPA but didn't really have anything that put it over the top for me.  I thought it was better than Heady Topper but not as good as Abner or Sip of Sunshine.  As I drank the beer and it warmed a bit I think the flavor and aroma released a little more so if I had it to do over I may let it warm some more.  It's a great example of a West Coast IPA but I wouldn't go out of my way to find or try this.  But if you have the chance it's not bad; check it off your list and move on to bigger and better beers. 1

I had opportunity to drink it head to head with a Heady Topper one evening here and I must say that was a battle for the ages... Heady barely eeked out the victory in my opinion but why listen to me go get your own and do it yourself.  Great hoppy bouquet my nose was in heaven... I don't get all "piny citrusy grapefruity etc..." about the hop combinations in my reviews but damn this seemed to have it all.

Aroma is of bright citrus  orange grapefruit  some pine too.  Taste matches the aroma very clean just like it's perfectly filtered body. Very well balanced. It's a beautiful beer but not hop bomb like some double IPAs. I'm curious to try this beer extremely fresh a few days old. I'll update review then. Overall it's a phenomenal beer  and a gold standard for west coast IPAs. I wish I could get this more often.

I'm doubtful of it though.  Had this on tap at RR and it completely lived up to the billing. To me it's the perfect beer and I'm bummed that I can't get it living in the Midwest.    The balance smell taste.....it's all incredible.

Thick white foam settles to thick layer  good lacings   I have been waiting a long time to try this beer. I can see how it set a standard for its time. I can also see how other beers were modeled on and improved on the style . Very good beer but not the ultimate

Smells like walking through a forest of pine trees. Tastes like a good does of pale malt with a dab of crystal malt followed by grass pine resin and grapefruit peel on the back end. Overall I find this to be one of the better balanced ipa's out there.

Pours bright clear orange amber head fades slowly leaving lace everywhere. Aroma jumps from the glass resiny pine and grapefruit fresh baked bread. Great balance in the taste toasty malt backbone with plenty of bitter resiny pine strong grapefruit peel floral notes. The flavor turns earthy woodsy just before a super dry finish. Medium full mouthfeel is super soft and oily slick. Trend now is towards the big juicy NE IPAs which I love but it's nice to come back to this world class resiny bomb. So delishous.

A clear pale golden pour into a snifter producing a billowy white head and some amazing lacing. Smell is almost subdued for a double IPA. I get floral hops grapefruit with some pine and a little dankness. Very nice. The taste is a great blend of those hop characteristics with very little bitterness. Great balance. Damn I am sold on this stuff. Definitely lives up to the hype for me. Wish I had another.

Look: Clear golden color with a sticky white head. Good retention. Smell: Pine and grapefruit. Taste: Similar to the aroma with lots of pine and grapefruit. Hops are well supported by a nice malt presence. Though the malts compliment the hops and do not overpower. Nice bitterness. Feel: Smooth with a good level of carbonation.  Overall: Always a pleasure to knock back a pint of Pliny. Has earned its spot as one of the best IPAs around. Cheers!

The aroma is pretty muted with some pine malt and citrus coming through. The taste is an even distribution of sweet malt hop bitterness and citrus. It's a great double IPA but I'm not a huge fan of the west coast malt profile.

Similar reaction to the clean taste of a fresh Sculpin the first time I tried that.  Very well balanced very light drinking for a DIPA or 8%.  Again exceptionally smooth clean and balanced and it's obviously very well made but the hype is a bit much.  For flavor I'd still prefer Cafe Racer 15 for a DIPA but they're just different styles of DIPAs.  I personally prefer a bolder taste but if you appreciate cleanness and balance then I'm not sure how you could do better for this style of beer.

Definite sweetness to the trail end of the smell. A tiny bit of alcohol. 5   Taste: Not as bitter as I expected at all the hops come through which leads into a citrus then grapefruit with a slight taste of pineapple to finish the segment.  The taste then shifts backs to hops and the pine and resin come through in the aftertaste.  For an 8% beer the alcohol is nearly undetectable. 5 (I'm a sucker for the hint of pineapple very refreshing)  Feel: Very good mouth feel crisp not too much carbonation. 4.5  Overall:  I am blown away by this beer my favorite IPA up to this point has been the sculpin and I feel this is much much better.  It appears once a month at the liquor store by my house and is limited to one per customer so Ill be hunting for another.  4.75

Just waves of floral hops with a such a freshly squeezed vibrancy you'd think you were smelling it right off the vine. The taste is so smooth & elegant for an American IPA. This is the standard because they don't just toss massive amounts of hops in to hammer you with the flavor or the bitterness.  You get a great sense and balance of the different hop flavors so while it might not taste vastly different than many other great IPAs - your orange citrus your grapefruit your pine etc - it is the balance and the ability of it to draw forth subtle hop variances to the surface that makes this such a well regarded beer. It is slick but not oily lighter on carbonation than I expected and it has just a faint lingering bitterness but it never overpowers the palate.

Bottles must remain fresh and cold for optimum flavor. It's always got a full nose and the flavor is a great mix of refreshing and bold. It takes the traditional Bitterness of an IPA and glorifies it. It doesn't shy away from the bitter rather leans into it.   Always good!

Fruity flavors on the front end that quickly get overpowered by the piney resinous bite.  Solid beer but definitely overhyped.

Quite resinous  T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the hops and never lets go. Pine and fruity notes stand out with hints of some spiciness. Malt provides a nice backbone and balances out the bitterness and resinous qualities of the hops quite a bit. Finishes with lingering light bitterness and more resiny notes  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Again very sticky and resinous  O: Definitely deserves the cult-like following it gets. Impressive in terms of drinkability despite the abv bitterness and resinous quality of the hops. Tough to top seek this one out

Cloudy amber in color.  Some carbonation bubbles.      S - Passion fruit grape fruit very sweet.  T - Sweet passion fruit front turns into stronger citrus notes.   Finish is a medium bitterness.  M - Very thick and smooth without much burn.  O - A fantastic DIPA.  So thick so sweet without an extreme IPA bitterness.

Oh and the hops in Pliny The Elder are right at the edge of being too much without crossing that line.   Perfection  Appearance: Bright amber gold. Nice one finger head which had staying power.   Flavor: A touch of malt with the predominant flavor being piney hops. Very well balanced.    Great finish that stays with you just enough.  Mouthfeel: Not to heavy and not to light but just right.   Definitely hits the Goldilocks zone.  Verdict :  Fantastic IPA. Very smooth considering the 8.0% ABV.  Great balance.  If you have never had this beer it is worth searching for.

LOOK: Pours with two finger's worth of white foam that dissipates into half a finger's worth after 1 minute and 45 seconds. Dark gold in color. Large amount of rising bubbles. Lacing is high and thick. SMELL: Strong aromas of piney hops meet strong aromas of apricots peaches mangos papayas tangerines oranges and grapefruits. Subtle sweet malts and bitter hops can also be detected. TASTE: Strong piney hop flavors enter initially along with mild sweet malts. Mild fruit flavors previously mentioned enter immiediately after along with strong bitter hop flavors as initial flavors persist. FEEL: Medium-bodied and subtly carbonated. Goes down extremely smooth. Finishes extremely dry.  NOTE: Diss. A. Pointed... Way too bitter. Don't see what the hype was about. It was great  don't get me wrong. But this is not world-class worthy. Fruits were stronger in the aromas than the taste. Perhaps because the bottle wasn't THAT fresh (only 26 days old). Yellow Rose was definitely better than this. 1

Hazy golden color with reasonably thick head.  Overpowering pine aromas and some resin.  Not much on the fruit side but a little citrus.  A little sweet but flavors are mostly piney and herbal.

Not a lot of dank this is different than heady. Little on the citrus side just a little grapefruit rind. This is the father of all the floral spicy and herbal dipas. Not too hoppy and that's why perhaps you hear once in a while how this is very disappointing beer. There is a significant present of nice bready malts in here.    Appearance: Clear bright golden in color. Nice little white foamy head. Those bubbles are just so beautiful to watch. Has a nice carbonation for a dipa.    Taste: malty sweet and bitter. Piney and spicy. Little herbal finish and nice little dryness. Wonderfull and complex.  Palate: The mouthfeel reminds me a lot of Blind Pig very unique and hard to articulate. Oily sticky and very lively.    Overall: Pliny is unique. The mouthfeel the carbonation the spicy/herbal/piney notes here are unique. Don't call this beer overrated because it's not better than heady or other east coast ipas. 1

Citrus piney hops and malt on the nose.  Sweet malt up front balanced by hops and a lingering piney finish.  Mouthful is medium to light and clean with medium carbonation and a long finish.  Overall this is quite nice.  I don't typically like ipa's but this is smooth and balanced.  The sweetness plays well with the hops which are not overwhelming.  I don't know if this lives up to the hype but it is definitely worth a try.

It is not my favorite in the style nor what I consider the tastiest but as a perfectly executed example of what (I think) it was trying to do it's definitely great.

Poured from a three week old bottle which is about as fresh as you can get it on the east coast. This was an incredibly smooth imperial IPA completely belying both the ABV and the bitterness/IPU number. Crystal clear filtered appearance with a big hit of pine and bitter citrus peel on the nose. West coast IPA for sure. The malts supported the bitter finish and pine resin flavor notes and the mouthfeel was superb with a level of carbonation that made this extremely drinkable and dare I say refreshing. Pliny the Elder is famous for a reason and imitator beers which try to ape its intoxicating blend of smoothness with hop bite are unlikely to touch it anytime soon.

This is my first time having pliny after all the hype and searching I took a sip. It came out as a light golden pint with a smell of pine and some fruit. It was a fragrant aroma but not the best ever. With the first sip I was instantly hit with the hop bitterness and pine notes but it was very well balanced with the malts. The ending was extremely dry leaving you begging for another sip. There is no doubt that this is a great IPA but is it the best IPA I've ever had? I wouldn't say so. I think the hype and scarcity play a lot into this. I have waited almost 4 years to try this beer and I would say I was a bit let down. As a bit of a comparison upon my first time having Zombie Dust I felt the hype was completely worth it.  Now before I am crucified on what I just said this is in no way less than an excellent IPA. Everything from the hunt to the taste make this beer an experience and the fact that with all the great IPAs currently on the market it can still be counted as a top 10 is extraordinary. If you ever have the chance to try a fresh PtE take it and enjoy it for the quality and for what it has done for the craft beer world a true legend. But if you never get the chance don't worry there are many other great (and maybe better) IPAs out there. 1

The aroma is of sharp resinous hop oil and white bread. Taste is of sweet white bread white bread crust and very bitter hops. Mouthfeel is high medium and slick and Pliny the Elder finishes puckering and decently drinkable (although you will feel it in your head).   RJT

The aroma was the star of this beer: a monstrous blast of fresh hops citric and spicy. The flavor was initially overwhelming sharp hop bitterness.  This faded to a pleasant biscuity malt flavor.  Medium high carbonation was almost prickly on the tongue but helped round out the mouthfeel of a beer that could have otherwise been a touch heavy.  Instead it is an easy drinking beer that finishes clean and sweet but short of sticky sweet and with a hint of the citrus and spice of the hops. Overall it is a fantastic IPA.

However I did just get a case straight from the brewery.  This is a well done IPA that is more finesse and less about the powerful hops.  Even a non-IPA fan would enjoy.

I'm not discrediting everyone's love of this beer  but it just didn't do it for me.  And I flew all the way to San Diego from Baltimore just to get some. (sniffle) It's the alcohol... I found it to be alcohol forward  overwhelming the hop and malt.  Too bad.  I'll try it again one day.

This just fell short of the hype.   It's good but seemed a tad flat 10 days after bottling. Not as much bite pine as I expected but it's good. Hype is a dangerous thing.

The nose on this beer is phenomenal. Tons and tons of citrus and grapefruit.  Super dank grapefruit grapefruit pith and citrus on the taste buds. Huge pop of bitterness on the back end. A true west coast DIPA. I can totally see what all the fuss is about. If you haven't experienced Mr. Pliny I'd strongly suggest to seek him out. Would drink this all the time if I had the opportunity.

Has a nice head on a proper pour and you don't need to bury your nose in the glass to get a waft of that amazing Hop.  Flavor is smooth and very piney. Has a bit of a bite upon the first sip but you quickly love every drop.

I liked it but its not my favorite.

Cause I didn't get the hop blast described by many.  Decent floral aroma and bit of citrus. It was smooth drinking and what many would describe as balanced.  I though the caramel malt taste was good but way overpowering for DIPA. Overrated based on this one bomber.

As I said when I reviewed Heady recently it's not my favorite style of beer but this is similarly a spectacular example of the style - a benchmark if you will.  If I were new to IPAs I could see this beer having the same earthshaking effect on me that Green Flash and Lagunitas' IPAs had on me that realization of "so this is why everyone likes this style!"  So it's a wonderful start IPA and as good an IPA as I could hope for but it's a big commitment to call it the "best."  Both the nose and taste have a blast of citrus/grapefruit which happens to be one of my favorite fruits so I love beers that taste that way.  Admittedly I have a sweet tooth for citrusy hops but this beer is not really that sweet and it's hardly bitter at all - it's just crisp tangy zesty and delicious.  Not as complex as Heady either which I think works to its advantage.  Some beers do well with a complexity and plethora of flavors but I think this one benefits from its straightforwardness.  The minuscule amount of malt mostly serves to give this beer that thick chewy texture I love in an IPA and the 8% abv is so well masked you could drink this all day until you realize you can't speak or stand properly.  Balanced but has a clear sense of purpose this beer is a perfect example of how to make a hoppy beer that doesn't rely on just having hops thrown at it until you're drowning in resin and bitterness.  The main downside to this beer is twofold - first that it's hype overshadows it's quality and second that it's historic value overshadows overall beer progress.  As I said earlier there are so many comparable and much more accessible beers out there that it's hard to justify going out of your way for this one for reasons besides curiosity.  I have to take points off my score just because in this day and age this is no longer a beer worthy of the exclusivity and prestige that it has cultivated.  So bottom line do whatever you can to drink it once and recognize it's majesty and then go back to your other favorites. 2

Look: Appears crystal golden and transparent.  Aroma: Piny hop aroma with some sweet malt. Would like more citrus (I get a little orange) or even more pine. Kind of a disappointing nose. Taste: Fruit rine and pine. A little sweet malt. A good balanced example of the west coast style.  Feel: Medium to medium-low body. Overall a good example of the west coast style and definitely balanaced as others have pointed out but I was hoping for something more. I can see why this was a world-class IPA years ago but in the current IPA market I can buy comparable beers at my local store.

A golden and light Amber body with a frothy head a little lacing left behind.   Smells really pretty: a floral and tropical citrus nose with subtle caramel malts.  These flavors are so well balanced. The malts provide just enough support the citrus notes and clean but not overly bitter finish.  The grain bill shows its mastery in mouthfeel too. A medium body that feels better and better as it warms up.   This beer delivers on all the hype.

A - Pours clear and golden with a nice white head that settles quickly and leaves some nice lacing. S - Malty with a hint of citrus. T - Malty hoppy and piney not much citrus. M - Crisp feel medium carbonation. O - Like any great beer the key is balance and this is an incredibly well balanced DIPA.  Very drinkable.  Hope I can get my hands on more of this soon.

A barely 2 week old bottle.  I don't have much to say that hasn't already been said except:  I will say up front a terrific beer. A benchmark for the style.  Worth drinking.  100%.  In 2002 this was one of the only Double IPA's to be had anywhere.  These days there are dozens and dozens of excellent DIPA's out there.    I think fear of missing out and wanting to be seen holding this beer are what really fuels the mystique in 2015.  Again world class excellent but if you can't find it easily there are many excellent alternatives that are right up there.

Tropical fruits and pine in the aroma. The fruitiness is very impressive.  Massive strong bitterness orange grapefruit peach pine. Alcohol is there but hiding behind the hops. Very easy drinking. Bitterness lingers but not too long. One of the best DIPA I have had.

So much hype I had to get five on my friend’s latest visit to RR (thanks Scott). Looking at this wonderful IIPA is probably something like seeing your first born child. And although the smell is orgasmic and the appearance is that of the Mona Lisa the beer fails to live up to the buildup. This is not to say that the brew is poor or subpar in any capacity but it is just not the third best IPA in the world. Simply put: it is not the third best IPA in the world. It’s fucking good. But it’s not the third best IPA in the world.

They handled the shipping pretty well despite the hot conditions of transit.  Those that underrate PtE may just be too cool for school or got a old batch. There's a reason it rates so high.  Piney but undeniably smooth for a DIPA.  ABV hidden well by complex notes of pine and citrus  Bottle dated 7.2.15  1 mo old holds up well.  If you don't like hoppy beer this may be a good introduction to the IPA world (if you can find it anywhere)

Fresh bottles + extreme heat can turn a once delicious Pliny into somewhat of a malt bomb. So if you can wait acquire through shipping in the colder months to avoid disappointment.

Just kidding.  But I am brownbagging it.   This beer is incredibly balanced - huge hop flavor and smell without being overly sweet - and will continue to be a benchmark regardless of trends.

Aroma was faint taste follows the aroma. Not as bold/hoppy as more recent IPA's. To be fair the bottle was over 2 months old and the beer was not as cold as I would like (bottleshare was outside in 90+ degrees). Hoping to try an fresh bottle and will update score.

Smelled the hops and something else that I can't quite place as soon as the top came off Poured out amber colored with a short but lasting head Tasted ok I was more impressed with other IPAs and APAs I've had recently. No where near the high hop taste of heady but more so than Zombie Dust. Not super heavy so if you like it drinking it all night would be great. Overall not a bad beer. Just not quite to my liking

The hops are certainly present but not at such levels as to rape your olfactory.   Appearance: amber-gold and bright. Head topped out at one finger which lasted the life of the beer approx 30 min.   Flavor: piney hops and toasted malt. Despite the hoppiness the toasted malt shares the stage. This beer is wonderfully balanced. The hop flavor is first on the scene but then yields to the toasted malt. Even in the finish the beer maintains a wonderful balance of malt/hops. The toasted malt flavor reminds me of Stone's RuinTen. No off flavors whatsoever. No alcohol flavor.  Mouthfeel: medium not so heavy as to prevent me from drinking several but enough to carry the hops and abv.   Overall: a great beer. The best IIPA available? No but one definitely worth pursuing. Just great balance. The beer is so smooth at 8.0% well-balanced and conservatively hopped for a IIPA that this beer could pass for a standard IPA.   Call it sacrilege perhaps  or simply personal preference but I prefer Stone's RuinTen to PtE. 1

Unfortunately Pliny is also starting to taste a little out of date in my opinion. I've had it recently on draft at RR and picked up bottles while I was there as well.  The word that best describes Pliny is 'Balance'. It's just the right amount of malt base with just the right amount of hop bitterness with a little juiciness like a DIPA should have. There's no question that PtE is expertly crafted.  That said the smell and taste left me wanting something more. I like really juicy DIPAs. Heady Topper juicy. Hops you can smell from across the room juicy. If you're expecting Pliny to compete with a juicy dank citrusy double like Heady then you'll be disappointed. It's simply not that beer.  tl:dr - PtE is a well made and balanced DIPA but it's not going to satisfy a true hop head.

Smell was actually a bit underwhelming not a bad smell by any means but with the hype of this beer I expected more. Taste:  Had a nice pine bitterness very smooth.  The aftertaste was minimal.  There was a very small lingering sweetness. Great feel to the beer.   As the beer warmed it definitely improved.  I'm not sure of recommended serving temp for it.  But it started out very good and ended tasting great. Shout out to beerxtrader for helping a rookie trader get a hold of this one.

Chunky lacing running down my empty pint glass confirmed the generous load of hops that went into this.

Nose is smooth with aroma of pine and citrus. Smooth from start to end with crisp and slight malt and bitterness. Solid DIPA that definitely lives up to hype.

This beer lives up to all the hype.  Smell is light citrus/fruit notes with a touch of pine all balanced perfectly through to the back.  No flavor out does the others.  Nice and smooth feel throughout no lingering after taste.  The only thing that lingers at the end is the desire for another sip.

Intensely hoppy beer with great aroma (more so on draft)  with pine overtones that really shined.  However I don't feel this beer lives up to its hype.  Is it a very good beer-  Absolutely. Is it a great beer.  Borderline.     There are many beers ranked far lower that I enjoyed far more

Apex Portland had this on tap and I happened to be in town. As it warmed I actually got more of the subtleties here. The bitter forward grapefruit centered hop profile shines here and proves to be the star as the blend of dankness and sweet slight malt kicks in on the back end.

Pours a terrific golden ale color that's perfectly clear. An inch of head that dissipates into a thin layer with nice lacing on the side of the glass.  Wonderful smell of pine grapefruit and mango. Complete in your face aroma. Taste is similar to the smell. Sweet malty notes that really ate balanced by delicious hop flavors. There is a dank finishing hop flavor not present in the aroma.  The feel starts as juicy but finishes smooth and dry leaving me wanting more and more.  Can't wait to trade for more.

Smell pine with grape fruity citrus underneath  Taste Follows the smell pine up front finishes dry with citrus great beer. Feel a little light but still full enough to coat the whole mouth. Overall this is a great beer! One of my favorites I would highly recommend anyone trade for it if at all possible.

Smells dank and floral with a hint of citrus as it warms up--I don't get the same fruity-ness that has overtaken DIPAs by now. Taste is superb--bitter hoppy a little sweetness and citrus with some nice nutty malt balancing it out. Almost a chewy creamy hoppiness. Totally fantastic. A true classic.   Bottle dated 2/12/16.

Taste is bitter and clean.  Mostly hop forward but not too much to throw off the balance.  A clean dry finish somewhat peppery.  Overall pretty good beer.  It didn't really live up to the hype for me.  I was expecting a bit more for an IPA this highly revered.  Good but not great.

It is worth the hype as long as you think of it as something that changed the game and realize that there are countless other fantastic DIPAs on the market.  It looks great perfectly clear.  Head is tight and retention is solid.  The only slight disappointment on this one is the nose seemed a bit weak to me.  I feel like I remember more floral and pine scent but there's a bit of sweetness that comes through over it.  The nose really is muted here for me with the malt far more present than on the palate.  Taste and feel are both perfect.  For 100 IBUs you'd almost never guess it.  I know some say this isn't supposed to be "balanced" but that's how I feel it comes across.  The slight malt sweetness is present but the hop flavor profile is wonderful.  It has a really great mouthfeel for DIPA - brash but awesome.    I know I'm not saying anything anyone else hasn't before but yeah it's incredibly good.  Edit:  Revisiting added a couple notes but kept the scores the same.  Nose is the only slightly weak mark here but might be that it's not quite as fresh as it's intended to be consumer (12/24/15 bottle consumed 2/9/16). 1

Look - Clean clear with deep yellow/golden color.  Was surprised.  I expected slightly hazy.  Smell - Overrun your nose with "fresh" smell.  The multitude of hops and balance is evident from the smell.  Taste - fantastic.  Refreshing the complexity of taste is tied in well with subtle malts.  This isn't punch you in the face DIPA.  It's smooth and unique and it doesn't need to do over the top bitter hops.  Feel - balanced and smooth with a malt backbone tying in the multiple hops.  Can be dangerously easy to drink.  Overall - a perfectly balanced DIPA.  The fresher the better and preferably on draft.

Back when it was cool to call yourself a "micro brewery" or more simply "We make our own beer here in the back" sort of pub. I've hunted beerz all over the east coast and Europe. I certainly do not profess myself as an expert but I know the difference between new/exciting and old/tired.  I finally got out to the west coast (San Francisco) and my wife and I made an overt effort to make sure we could try The Elder before we left. Thanks to the incredible La Trappe Cafe we found the supposive godfather of all IPAs. Needless to say we were not too impressed.   Frankly I believe it not the fault of Russian RIver but more to the fact that today's brewers have caught up. Just two weeks ago we were at (of all places...) Busch Gardens  in Tampa Florida and we were served a "Quackalope" from a local brewery named "Barley Mow". Never heard of them but this beer was incredible. To me the folks at Barley Mow represents how far-along  newers craft brewers have traveled towards great and updated tastes.  For those of you who consider themselves unsatiated until experiencing coveted beers such as Pliny the Elder spend more time enjoying the selections of your local brewers. They may certainly be doing it better than you realise thanks to lessons learned from trendsetters such as Russian River. 1

Tons of carbonation. Bright white fluffy head.  Smell/aroma: Super dank piney grapefruit grapefruit pith. Very bitter in your face hops. West Coast style at its finest.  Taste: Upfront grapefruit bitterness orange pine resinous dank hops. Grapefruit rind orange pith on the back end. Bitterness lingers but the bready malts balance Pliny well. Overall: Pliny is a crowd pleaser. It is on point for a DIPA. Yes its worth tge hypr get it fresh as you can. Everyone has their own tastes but from my POV this is a winner. Don't skip on the Blind Pig if your in the area as well!!

It's a great one.  I always pick it up when available.  Russian River is special because you can tell that they really try their hardest to focus on perfecting their product.  Creamy mouthfeel sharp and intricate hop flavor great body and delicious all around finish.  Pretty hard to beat!

Appearance: Pours a gorgeous golden color. The head is three fingers high and vaguely off-white in shade. Retention is fantastic while the rocky head leaves behind thick webs of lacing on the glass. This one looks absolutely killer. (4.5)  Smell: This is a fairly typical DIPA aroma all told. I can see where so many beers in the style got their influence from. Piny grassy notes seem to dominate though I do pick up hints of grapefruit. The malt backbone is wonderfully neutral - it brings touches of cracker and white bread and that's about it. I admit gravitating more to the new school of DIPAs. But still I'm not exactly disappointed by the nose by any stretch. (4)  Taste: At first I get gentle hints of spruce grass and flowers. The more I drink the more floral the flavor becomes. Malt appears past the midtaste (a bit more than the nose suggested) with some caramel white bread and sugar cookie flavors. Maybe even touches of earth wood and toffee. I could say that nothing about this brew really stands out...but I won't. No every flavor here seems to pop with a bit more definition than MANY other DIPAs out there - and that's saying something considering how this is far more complex than the typical DIPA. (4.25)  Mouthfeel: This is amazingly crisp and DRY (when I say dry I mean frickin' dry). Some malt sweetness and heft does appear but it's a feature that is less annoying than many others in the style. I could drink this one all day that's for sure. I don't really notice the carbonation one way or the other - translation it's doing its job perfectly. (4.75)  Overall: I knew this wouldn't be some super innovative new school DIPA loaded with Galaxy hops. Nope this is to DIPAs what Black Sabbath's self-titled album was to heavy metal. Even now this has the finesse and sophistication that many in the style wished they had a tenth of. The first sip didn't bowl me over and then I kept drinking it...and drinking it...and drinking it. Around the halfway mark it dawned on me: "this is a fantastic DIPA". This isn't something you sample 3-4 oz of this is something you down pint after pint of at the Toronado in SF all while Dark Angel is blaring in the background (screaming match with surly bartender optional). (4.5)  4.31/5: Should be considered the quintessential west coast DIPA even with all the pretenders flooding the market 2

I think there are better ones out there for sure but it was still a delicious beer. A bit more malty than expected but had a nice pine flavor profile from the hops that worked nicely. The bottle I had was 2.5 weeks old so I don't think I will get much fresher in Ohio!

A- Creamy white head disappeared into a thin whisky head with nice lacing. Pours a hazy yellow.   S- Grass pine orange peel nice floral notes  T- really delicious. A lot of grass and pine with some citrus notes as well. Much more balanced than I expected. Really pleasant hop flavors without a big punch to the mouth. The finish is fairly clean some hop character lingers.  M- medium body creamy perfect carbonation.  O- worth its reputation. Not a super hop bomb but a more balanced DIPA. Really nice fresh floral grass and Pune notes and a perfect mouthfeel. Very happy I was able to try this.

Pours orange with tall long lasting fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops tropical fruit and bready malt. Body is full and tangy. Citrusy herbal hops dominate the flavor while bready and caramel malt and tropical fruit provide some balance. Finish is long massive very bitter grapefruity. Amazing brew.

Found 4 pints shipped one to my brother and kept the rest.  This one definitely lived up to the hype for me.  Was by far the smoothest IPA I've tasted it had a great citrusy wonderful aroma.  I will be keeping tabs on the delivery schedule for this stuff in the future.

Well sought out highly hyped up and lived up to every last praise. Picked up a couple of 510s at BDBS in Gaslamp (they were in the back) and immediately cracked a cold one back at the hotel. The only thing that may have improved this is my Spiegelau! Beautiful orange/amber color with a finger of white head. Huge West Coast IIPA nose full of citrus (orange lemon) and strong pine. Similar notes to taste yet exceptionally pronounced. Opened up greatly as the brew was slowly sipped and savored. Clean dry finish. The benchmark for the IIPA style for me moving forward.

Thick white head with lasting retention.  Smells like citrus mostly orange peel to me.  Some pine.  Taste is similar tart orange peel with a pine finish. Great clean lingering pine finish.  Medium to medium low carbonation from the bottle.  Had a couple pints at the source that seemed more carbonated. I preferred those.  The slightly higher carbonation of the draft beer made the great hops flavor linger longer on the tongue.  Overall for once a beer mostly lived up to the hype. The best example of a west coast style IIPA I've ever had. Or any IIPA for that matter. One I will judge others off of. Now I just need an excuse to visit Santa Rosa again. The sooner the better!

Both are definitely world class but I give the edge to Pliny thanks to stone brewery for bringing Pliny down here to the Mecca.

A couple great bottle shops in Sd offer this beer once a month and it flies off the shelves. Scent is very piny with small hints of citrus. Medium to low mouthfeel providing a smooth aftertaste. Always worth a pint or bottle purchase.

This beer has a good mix of aroma balanced taste and drinkability. This is an IPA that I could see myself drinking all day long. I feel like the name threw me off some however. I'd love to try blind with some others for comparison sake.

After pour the 1 thick head stuck around for the majority of drinking. The head was very creamy and left some beautiful lacing lines after each sip. The lacing held strong the entire time.   S: strong hoppyness. Some medium earth notes with a slight sweetness that balances out this smell. Slightly musky and a touch of pine resin  T: very resinous and moderately earthy with a strong malt backbone. The hops take a good amount of bite out but the malt still prevails. A touch of grapefruit and a underlying copper taste due to the malt. Very dank earth finish long after.   F: very think for an IPA and really creamy head taste. The carbonation balances the malt stickyness and leaves a light slightly dry finish.

Very similar bitterness and citrus fruit presence one would anticipate from the style but every aspect seems to just be a little better than the competition.  Excellent carbonation level and mouthfeel for an IPA with a great taste and a good nose.

Aroma is malty bready a hint of hops. Taste brings the hops forward but this is a not big hoppy IPA so they support the malt bill working with it. very well rounded smooth nice textures. Worthy of its reputation. Been seeking this for a while.

Imaging my surprise when it turned out to be an APA. My friend didn't care for this too much he is a double stout type. That's OK I drank them all myself. Must say this is really good and when I again come up with $10 for a 6 pack I will certainly revisit. Looks like beer Smells like beer Tastes like an IPA

I still like it but having tried many IPAs over the past few years it does not stand out as it once did. It’s a great beer and I always have some in my fridge but have gravitated toward some other IPAs that are more hop forward and more bold in terms of citrus pine and other fruits.

Smells of pine with some citrus fruits like grapefruit and orange rind. Taste follows the nose well with a hit of bitterness up front followed by some piney notes then some citrusy notes. Overall a great classic ipa that I could drink everyday anytime . Great beer

It pours a nice orange color with a small head and tastes hoppy and piney with a smooth-dry finish.  If I had to pick a beer to drink before a nice day of skiing in the UP oh Youbetcha it would be a two hearted...

Not horrible but not remarkable. absolutely no reason to drink this when in NY there are so many other way better hop driven beers. Could be I am getting old bottles but the ratings for this beer seem like fake news to me ...

Smell is definately hoppy typical for me he style. Initial taste is hoppy with mostly piney flavors then mellow out to a dry bitter finish. Overall a good solid not over the top IPA I've had pale ales that were stronger in bitterness but this is mild enough to make it enjoyable would drink again

Nose is earthy. Pine and floral with a touch of citrus peel to balance. Taste is sweet up front sweet dough malt and citrus. That is followed by floral notes grass and pine. Nice bitter kick to it. Full bodied not overly creamy but at times it does have that creamy mouthfeel to it. A very good beer that has a little bit of everything from malt sweetness floral earth and pine as well as citrus.

For me personally it's a different IPA than your traditional west coast IPAs. It's got a nice sweet smell on the nose almost like a sweet citrusy smell. Also a really nice floral aroma and a touch of pine. This is a very unique IPA. If you haven't tried this yet try it! If you like IPAs you definitely won't be disappointed. Make sure it's fresh though!

From the first sip to the last it retains its great taste. Not too bitter. Perfect blend of hoppiness taste and overall drinkability.

The beer pours slightly hazy light amber with sticky off white head.  Retention and lacing are above average.  The aroma is citrus and pine.  The taste is a lovely balance of caramel malt and citrus & pine from the centennial hops.  Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied well carbonated and mostly dry in the finish.  There is a little sticky hop oil and caramel finish that is again: balanced.  Overall excellent.  The hardest thing about reviewing this beer is slowing down enough to take some notes.  If you enjoy a balanced IPA and find this fresh get some.

This brew pours out a shade akin to golden brown or amber. Thick 2 finger thick tan head on this beaut. Nose is of citrus and ripe fruitperhaps some grapefruit.    Tastes exactly how it smells. Probably the only beer i've ever had that does this to a T. Body is medium not too dry. alcohol taste is superbly hidden. Two hearted is a staple in my fridge and always will be.   Do yourself a huge favor and try some today. Cheers.

Color is a light hazy yellow orange. Nice lacing while drinking. Smell is light citrus and hops. Taste is very well balanced and somewhat complex. Strong hops but not bitter. Later taste is mild malt and ripe fruit. Feel is medium with ample carbonation that entices the taste buds. This is an excellent AIPA.

It's a heavier IPA with a lot of foam. It smelled like malt with a hint of fruit which I enjoyed. I felt like the taste was bland especially compared to the smell. I thought my poor review of this beer was an abnormality until my friend from Texas and my brother in New Jersey told me they too were underwhelmed with this beer. Simply put I would not buy this beer again.

Smells: Fantastic notes of citrus especially mild grapefruit.  Taste: Very good smell of grapefruit does not survive the tastebuds. Very smooth and drinkable for an IPA. High ABV for an IPA at 7.0%.  Feel: light body. Again very drinkable.   I’d get this one again.

I will say for all of the attributes it is a very well balanced IPA in every regard enjoyable while you are drinking. For me it's not really memorable or something that I would go out of my to find to have again.  Look: Basic Pale Ale nice color. The ones that were poured for me from the tap were a little hazy. Nice head in the glass. Smell: Nice and citrusy not overwhelming. Taste: Dry well balanced but not as much malt in the background as I come to expect from the reputation. Feel: Nothing remarkable felt like an IPA maybe a touch thin. Overall: A good representation of the style I would drink again.

The head to this brew sticks around. There is a nice amount of lacing to this brew it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness earthy grains and malts. This brew has the look and smell of most American IPA's on the market not saying that is a bad thing. Now for the taste it is Bold with flavors. You first pick up on the Hoppy bitterness the a nice smoothness of earthy grains and malts. There is also a nice slight sweetness at the end note of this brew.  Two hearted Ale  has a lot going on in it. The body of this American IPA is a solid medium. There is nothing overpowering about this brew it has a real nice balance to it. This is one of the more enjoyable IPA's I have had in awhile. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.00% ABV in this brewit is just that smooth.  I can't get over how smooth this brew goes down. This brew would go nice with dinner. The mouth feel is Bold Rich Hoppy Smooth Clean and Refreshing. Overall I'm Two Hearted Ale a 4.50 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Bell's Brewery Inc. did a super nice job with this American IPA. 1

Moderate carbonation foamy thick head.  Smells mainly of grapefruit and piney and mildly grassy hops; orange pineapple overall smells sweet and floral.  Blatant grapefruit rushes the mouth with a slight lemon tartness that supplements with it orange citrus flavor present as well. Somewhat bitter piney taste and aftertaste. Smooth floaty feeling.

The aftertaste has more of the bitterness than in the drinking of the beer. It is in the mid price range of IPAs at my bottle shop which makes me feel like I am getting a great beer at a good price.

A little over 2 weeks old AMAZING FIND at this local grocery store! Hopefully it wasn't stored in hot warehouse! Deep gold pour with immediate hop aromas! Excellent balance between the malt and hops with low amount of bitterness! Very crushable and TASTY! Beautifully made beer! I can now taste the reason this has always been a standard bearer for IPA's!  I could see this being drank throughout the year (But spring and summer is best for me!) Thanks Bell's!  Find and drink amazing beers! SEH P.S. Price point for this beer is great @ $1.75 a bottle!!!! What a break from spending $4 - $6 a can/bottle of local craft beers nowadays!! AHHH!

The hops finish for quite a while on my palate which is nice. I get a bit of bitter lemongrass and grains.  It's a beautiful color nice golden with some haze.  I get lots of malt on this it's sort of heavy and it is filling. Great for colder weather. The feel makes you want another sip though. I think it could possibly pass for a Pale Ale but who really cares?  It's goodworth drinking and I really like it.

Very tropical and almost too sweet to the nose for an IPA. The taste is more than redeeming with a great balance of malt and hoppiness leaning mostly to tropical and citrus notes attributed to the Centennial hops.

Decent retention and good lacing S -- Pretty big malt citrus and floral presence with a faint skunkiness and sweet earthiness taking up the rear T -- Lots of herbaceous earthy and grassy flavors. Some caramely sweetness from the malts and there's a faint citrus note in the background that I'm just barely picking up on. Quite bitter F -- Medium+ mouthfeel medium carb. Flavors are too skewed towards earthen hoppy bitterness and the finish is a little puckering O -- Reminds me a lot of Racer 5 IPA and like with Racer 5 I found this brew to be too one-dimensional in its earthen bitterness and only slight floral and citrus presence to offset the heavy malting going on  72/100

Overall a well rounded beer with strong initial hops on the palate followed by a bold deep citrus flavor.  While it may be a step below top notch IPA brands this beer does have a unique flavor which makes it a solid beer that I will revisit on occasion.

Aroma is sweet citrus malt not screaming IPA and fairly muted. The taste is sweet malt up front followed by a medium bitterness that lingers citrusy grainy somewhat juicy mouthfeel. Not really sure what all the fuss on this beer is was expecting so much more.

Appearance: Clear pale gold with a tall lush frothy head of white foam and spotty lace.  Smell: Light grainy aroma with plenty of citric hops: citrus zest faint tropical fruit and grass.  Taste: Pale malts build a solid lightly sweet base for waves of hops. Citrus grapefruit rind pineapple and herbal pine resin. Closes with a clean crisp bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium body slightly oily feel and crisp moderate carbonation.  Overall: Solid classic IPA; nothing heavy handed just well balanced and very drinkable.

Overall two hearted has a better hop flavor; more citrusy and less bitter. Diabolical is maltier and generally a bit more bitter. Two hearted pours a cloudy light amber with a decent head. Both are well crafted brews with the style differences the most distinguishing difference.

L: Pours like a legit American IPA amber with a moderate head S: Grapefruit and malty smell knew immediately that this was gonna be a smooth finish.  T: Real let down doesn't pack a punch or really differentiate itself hype definitely made it worse for me. Grapefruitty taste with a malty almost frothy finish. Too light. F: Smooth but lacking character. As our "president" would say: SAD! O: 3.69 nothing great but definitely not a bad beer. Would recommend at like a relatively poor package store otherwise there will be better beers on the shelf.

Really smooth on the swallow.  It feels like I'm inhaling a small amount of hops with a smooth swill when I take a drink.  Overall I don't think it's the standard (Sculpin) but  a great beer nonetheless.

Smell is all centennial hops: great pleasant flavor simple and enticing.   Taste is similarly simple but great: malt is light noticeable and balancing yeast leaves a hint of fruitiness but the centennial takes the finish with the pleasant light grapefruit and earthy hop presence even light floral/herbal note as well.   The mouthfeel of this beer has always been a standout component: lightly sweet but bitter - flavor lingers on the tongue and bitterness has a good presence throughout.   Overall: a style defining beer a beer i've always gone to on tap when looking for an ipa and one you want to emulate in your homebrewing repertoire.

It has a mix of hops that creates a strong citrus aroma and a bitter/sour mix flavor mix that shouts grapefruit. The haze suspends the flavors which coat the tastebuds. A little more carbonation would add to the mix. This is my favorite American ale.

Strong citrus and floral aromas from the hops. I'd be hard pressed to say much about taste notes beyond grapefruit orange and pine but the beer has a nice kick to it and a crisp finish that dries out the mouth like a real IPA. This beer reminds me a lot of Oberon but with a hefty dose of Centennial hops in place of the wheat. It's very near perfect.

It has a very rich and smooth flavor. It smells fantastic...very aromatic floral light pine and light citrus. 7% abv but doesn't taste boozy. Goes down easy and doesn't suffer from a bitter ending. Delicious..definitely recommend.

It has a pleasing amber color as it pours out creating a nice foamy head. The taste is quite flavorful probably one of the best that there is in an IPA and not overly pungent as some others. The taste of the ale lingers over the palate; truly an outstanding quality. It has a very pleasing aroma unlike some others. I have tried this beer before but it had been awhile back and I wanted to try it again; and it will be on my list of brews to get again.

Orange and tangerine up front that's quickly met with coniferous resiny bitterness. I remember first having this beer when I split a pitcher of it with a friend in college at the Blue Leprechaun in Ann Arbor. I was blown away by how good it was. Many many IPAs later this still is a great beer to me.

Since our last name  is Bell I've  always had an affinity for Bell's Brewery. Some really good brews and this one is REALLY good. His the spot just right!

355,/beer/profile/287/1093/,4.34,look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5,ipeters1017,From a 12 oz bottle dated 5/1/17. Pours a slightly hazy reddish orange with a big head leaving a lot of lacing down the glass. The smell is packed with citrus but that's about all I'm getting.  This is a hop bomb as soon as it hits my mouth but it backs off quickly. Citrus-y and fruity with an underlying sweetness to it that's especially prevalent in big gulps. There's definitely some tangerine in here. The bitterness is nice not too harsh and is accompanied by just a hint of pine that you don't really get in the nose but it lingers in the aftertaste. One of the most complex IPAs I've encountered and I'm a big fan.   Mouthfeel is medium-bodied not too heavy or sticky and not too thin and carbonated either just about the perfect feel for an IPA. This is extremely drinkable refreshing and great for the price.

Lovely orange/amber color.  Very hazy.  Two finger head that settles rocky and lasts.  Some sticky lacing after beer warms.  The smell is clean citrus hops with an underlying fruitiness.  Grapefruit and tangerine.  Maybe strawberries?  My wife who does not drink at all thinks the smell is terrific.  Taste is of course hops up front.  The rest completely follows the nose.  Both citrus and some melon.  Watermelon?  Malts are not outstanding but with enough backbone to carry and balance the hops but is not huge on the palate.  Very juicy.   Medium body that carries the hops well.  Building malts as as the beer warms leaving a bit of bread on the finish for a fuller mouthfeel.  Crisp fresh and extremely drinkable.   Definitely carved out a spot in my beer cooler.

As the name implies this is one of the sweethearts of IPAs & deservedly so. I am not a big IPA guy but there are afew exceptions & this may find itself on this short list.  Pours with abright white tight suds head floating on a rich lightly hazed honey golden hue. The head gives way to sparce lacing. The most remarkable trait is the luscious texture rife with fruity essence. I find the lavor bordering on an apricot/peach tinge. Hearesey you say? Perhaps but it's all a matter of taste.  As I usually avoid IPAs I'm not comfortable drawing comparisons but I know what I like & it's easy to see why this has such a following.  Thank you Bell's for opening my eyes. I'm pleased add it to the short list shared by Cigar City Jai Lai Racer 5 & perhaps   5 other of the hundreds out there.

The bitterness is just right. It has the classic "grapefruit" taste but not as strong as something like Dogfish Head. If you like IPA's you'll love it. If you're not familiar with IPA's this is a good one to start with. The price is right around $10-11.00 for a 6 pack of bottles. 4 packs of cans aren't much cheaper. If you do end up with cans remember this isn't Busch Light. Give it some dignity and pour it into a glass. ;)

Some ringy lace slightly sticky. The aroma had a wonderful dose of sweet fresh pine floral bitterness and  sturdy caramel malt base. The flavor was a fabulous blend of the prior aromatic qualities - sweet to bitter and back through intertwining eloquently into a clean aftertaste. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt appropriate. Overall pretty nice AIPA that brought me into the beer world when I lived in Michigan. Always a post fishing beer whenever I finished fishing the St. Mary's River in Sault Ste. Marie.

This gives a 2 finger head. The color is a light straw. The aroma is a nice citrusey pine. The taste is a distinct citrus/pine. Bitterness is mild toward the back of the palate with a hint of malt which offers a smooth finish. Overall love the flavors but not quite as crisp and refreshing as Sierra Nevada.

A perfectly biting flavor of citrus/hop/malt without the need of a pinch of this and a pinch of that (which I favor as well but this one doesn't need the extra alchemy it's near perfect as is).   This used to be a regular for me then I got lured by the new - what sweet delight to revisit liquid bliss. Sometimes comfort comes from happy familiarity.

Smell is crisp yet faint. Eating jalapeno hummus it's hard to pinpoint taste exactly but it's certainly as crisp as it's carbonation. Best I've had from this brewery.

At 7% its right in the middle of the pack in strength. The taste is a perfect blend of hops and malt. And at the price point it's a very reasonable daily drinker. I recommend any ipa enthusiast to try this if they haven't already.

The aroma is very nice with touches of citrus a little pine and just a really nice citrus smell.  Taste: Not really one overwhelming taste.  A nice blend of multiple flavors with all of them blending nicely.  The one flavor you do get is the nice citrus you expect from an IPA.   Overall this is a very good beer that is extremely smooth and easy to drink.  No trace of the 7% alcohol present and just a really nice looking and tasting beer.

With an incredible creamy white head and lacework balance   and mouthfeel to spare a nose of citrus and just-enough pine and the most enjoyable hop-soup palate for this type of IPA you'll ever find Two Hearted is a Midwestern classic that you can't leave behind once you've left. I  love this beer.

S: Floral citrus very lemony some pine a bit grassy some bready malt and a little caramel sweetness.  T: Floral citrus lemon grapefruit spicy pine bready malt and caramel sweetness.  M: Medium body moderate carbonation.  O: It's hard to compare an old school IPA like this to all the modern super hopped stuff but it still holds its own. Really nice use of centennial hops.

Always wanted to try it and it didn't disappoint. I call it classic representation of Midwest IPA. Floral piney slightly amber great malt balance and incredibly long lasting finish. Loved it!

The smell is divine with very rich floral scents bursting out. The taste is very strong with intense citrus flavor. Pretty bitter but still immensely drinkable. Every beer drinker should have a 6 pack of this available at all times.

L- Thick soapy white colored head that stands 1 finger tallwith very good retention and sticky lacing.Light orange colored body with low clarityand distorted light showing through the glass.Low amount of carbonationhigh amount of sediment.  S- On the nose I get tons of citrus and tropical fruit hops (orange and mango)pine hopsand some faint hints of sweet breaded malt notes.Fruity hops definitely steal the show.Floral hop presence as well.  T- On the palate I get bitter pine hops and grapefruit up fronttropical and citrus fruit hops in the middleand some sweat breaded malts balanced by pine hops on the back end.Very well balanced IPA.  F- The mouth feel is bordering on thin and mediumwith a silky texture.Moderate amount of oxidation on the tongue with a smooth finish.  O- This is probably one of the best IPA's I have triedthat is available in Florida.Very well balanced with a beautiful hop presence.This is about as close to a "juice bomb" as you get in Florida.I could drink this beer all year round.I highly recommend this brew if you are a hop headand an IPA lover. 1

473,/beer/profile/287/1093/,4.3,look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25,ScaryEd,Poured from a 12 oz bottle dated 02/28/17 into a snifter.  Pours a lightly hazy golden orange color with a finger of off-white head. The head settles into a thin film that rests atop the beer leaving a ton of lacing as it goes. Pretty much the perfect looking beer. Beer porn if you will.  The aroma is extremely floral and dank bringing notes of ruby red grapefruit orange peel and sticky pine. The back end is full of toasted malt bringing a good amount of balance to the aroma.  The taste is more of the same. Orange and grapefruit followed by some sweet caramel malt and finished off by a tidal wave of pine.  The feel is medium-light bodied with good carbonation. Goes down very smooth yet has a crisp bite to it that is quite refreshing. Very dry and resinous.  Overall an excellent IPA. It's far from the biggest or baddest IPA out there but it's exceptionally balanced and extremely well-made. This is a beer I could drink all year long and I wish I could.

A little bit boozy but its not overpowering. carbonation is perfect.  makes it feel lighter.  This would be fantastic if it was ice cold on a hot day.  not really a session beer (ABV 7%) but I could definitely rip through a bunch of these in rapid succession. I don't love IPA but this is about as good as I've ever had.  I'll definitely have another  edit:  This beer changed my whole opinion of IPA.  Prior to this beer I did not appreciate this style; after this beer IPA is a favorite style.  life changer.

Will not avoid but will not go out of my way to get it either.

Pours a slightly hazy amber with a nice two finger head that is thick and foamy lasting and has good lacing. It has a decent aroma of sweet citrusy hops and bready malts. Sweet hoppy and mildly bitter it has a decent malt to hop balance with some caramel sweetness and a smooth finish. Light to medium body and carbonation this drinks fast.  This is good stuff not a hoppy juice bomb but a great representative IPA.

I just got Two Hearted this time because there were one or two more exciting choices and a LOT of really cheap incredible beers or ones that I hadn't heard of.  Pours an orange gold with a bit of haze into a pint glass. Keeps a thin ring of foam and one-sided spotty lacing. The smell and taste take this to a whole new level.  Smell is dank piney grapefruit thing wreeks of hops. Taste follows suit with the hoppy bitter pine grass grapefruit and a floral aftertaste. This beer is pretty crazy good. I very much regret not going ahead and grabbing the full Bell's catalogue available at the store so I could give all their beers a shot.   Maybe you guys across the country are spoiled but this is super good and deserves the ratings I am throwing at it. The freshness has to have something to do with it being packaged on 2/21/17. Good shit!

Nose is bready with citrus and pine.  Taste is something else. As in something unlike so many ipa's that have soaked the market.....this  Juicy grapefruit massive hop bitterness. Tasty in that another sip can't come soon enough. Peppery with what to me has a pilsner-like malt quality and it feels so smooth...medium-bodied. Zesty orange notes come through as I sip it longer. Impressive IPA taste. I'm equally impressed by the malt backbone. The flavor and balance with the centennial hops is superb there. The easiest benchmark IPA to compare it with as far as centennial-hopped IPAs go would be Founder's IPA. Only issue there in my book is that this Bell's IPA appears to be the new benchmark. Glad they came to Texas.

Less than two months old packaged on 12/21/16. Poured into a tulip glass.   Look: This beer has a beautiful semi translucent burnt orange color with a thick creamy white head that dissipates after a minute or two. The color is reminiscent of orange marmalade.  Smell: The smell is the only subtle part of this beer. Grapefruit rind with a backdrop of pine needles and subtle floral scent.  Taste: A blast of grapefruit and mango to the palate with associated bitterness that is balanced out by a backbone of malt. The malt is very clearly the support player and does not add much besides a balancing sweetness for the hops. The pine taste comes near the end with the lingering but pleasant bitterness on the back and sides of my tongue.  Feel: Medium body with moderate carbonation. Dry finish. Overall: This is a beautiful showcase of centennial hops and one of the best examples of an old school American IPA. At 7% alcohol it is extremely drinkable and could pass off as a 5% beer (until you get about 4 beers deep lol). This is the second Bell's beer I have ever had (being from Oregon) and the hype was well deserved. I could drink this beer all day. For being a single hopped IPA there is a great complexity of flavor that truly speaks to the allure of the Centennial hop and why it has become such a powerhouse in the American craft brewing scene. 1
581,/beer/profile/287/1093/,4.5,look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5,BloodSoakedAleMug,Sampled from a fresh can.  Look: Pours a bright translucent orange hue with a billowing two finger eggshell colored hell.  Aroma: Lots of orange and grapefruit pith with generous amounts of resinous piney hops.  Taste: I'm getting sweet grapefruit bitter orange rind and a juicy mango flavor capped off by gentle but somewhat assertive pine resin. Over time a biscuity malty vanilla taste becomes pronounced. It almost tastes like orange sherbet as it warms.  Feel: Even at 7% I could crush these back to back. Not trying to brag but this beer is seriously thirst quenching and smooth. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Dry and bittersweet but effervescent and crisp.  Overall: One of my go to IPAs. Can't go wrong with this one. Two hearted ale has something to offer for the novice IPA drinker and seasoned IPA vet alike.

S: Possibly the best floral beer I have smelled before. Really stands out among all the floral IPAs that I have had in terms of aroma. My favorite part of this beer. Some pine and grapefruit as well. T: Again the floral hops are the shining part of this beer.  Floral pine malt minor citrus. F: quite smooth O: A very bold uncommon and flavorful IPA yet sessionable. I can definitely do more of this!

This one is a sure value. Plenty of flavorful hops Just the right bitterness and a reasonable ABV of 7%.  Enjoyed both draft pints and bottled.  Last orders please. Give me another!   ~PS. Just reading that this ale might be a single-hop Centenial. Wow!  So much flavor!

Drank less than 1 month after purchase.  Appearance: Deep gold body  with thick light-tan head. Beer is clear and not cloudy. Head is thick and leaves a nice lacing on the glass.  Smell: Aroma filled with a strong hops aroma and includes grapefruit pepper and pine smells.  Taste: There is a noticeable hops flavor as expected from an American IPA. There is good bite from the hops along with other flavors like citrus but the hops bitterness is not overpowering. There is a little sweetness from the malts. The aftertaste provides a variety of flavors over time.  Not overly bitter or hoppy and has a great balance.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Medium alcohol which matches the 7.0% posted.  This is a smooth medium-bodied beer that is easy to drink. It is one of the best IPAs I have drank and is very well balanced.  The aftertaste is really enjoyable.  I would definitely drink this again.

Poured from a bottle into a snifter with a great foamy head and nice lacing cloudy gold-orange color. Floral smell. Citrus taste with a nice mixture of pine and bitterness. A great beer.

Poured from a single bottle into my tulip glass. Darker and oranger than expected in the glass. Nice foam and some lacing that sticks around a bit. I did not like the smell it struck me as rather bland and too subtle. My first few sips were more about trying to figure out the taste than enjoying it. Before I got half way through I warmed up to the taste and feel of it. It's not complex. I was over thinking it. Solid but I'd prefer something more interesting or to try something new.

666,/beer/profile/287/1093/,4.63,look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5,Eric_Smith,Forgive me this is my first attempt at a full-blown review:  Pours a golden/amber. The head is aggressive 1.5-2" but quickly retreats evenly. Lacing is minimal a light film. Quite clear with normal carbonation. Heavy aromatics and floral piney and citrus notes on the front. Some light wheat-y sweet indicators.  Citrus dominates with orange peel bitterness. Light grapefruit and rose notes. Then orange peel and lemongrass. Overall very nice aroma. Flavor comes in with heavier grapefruit than the aroma would indicate. NIce transition from sweet fruit to hops bittering. Flavor is quite intense. Balanced but more sweet in front and bitter behind. BItter lasts long and builds throughout the session but it's not off-putting. Mouthfeeel is quite full for a beer so light and clear. Very satisfying but at the same time sessionable. Alcohol content while high for its type is an afterthought. Personally this is one of the best beers of this type I have had. Very drinkable yet still complex enough to keep you wondering. 1

Very well balanced taste. Not the hops bomb I was expecting  this beer goes from hoppy to malty quickly with a dry finish. Decent amount of carbonation. This is an easy drinker in the IPA class. No real lingering bitterness. I like this one.

It always impresses and I love the 16 ounce can. There may be better ones out there but this one works for me. Pours and amber yellow with a nice head and great lacing. And the taste just works for me. Not too bitter and not too fruity. Wonderful mouthfeel.

Other raters have talked about its floral or citrus notes but I don't care for either floral or citrus and it tastes great to me a wee-heavy ale.  I say it's a first beer because it is a little heavy and one is great two I can't finish.  Highland Gaelic by comparison is not bad but it's not even half the character of this beer.  If you like Two-Hearted but want to go lighter for your second Highland Gaelic or Rogue Dead Guy might be candidates.  (I would have mentioned Highland Kashmir IPA if it were still around.)

Aroma is equally malt and hops which is a harbinger of things to come.  Malt is rich and the spicy conifer hops are in sharp focus.  Taste is hop forward on entry announcing they're there without overshadowing the malt which appears mid palate to balance the hops then both march abreast to the finish which is clean with a lingering hop bitter/sharp note which quickly fades.  A subtle dry finish that invites another taste.  Medium texture with a roundness that's appealing.  Overall it's easy to see why this one is so well spoken of.  Malt and hops achieve a ringing balance that belie the overall complexity one gets after studying the beer a bit.  Yes I know it's ale but I call them all beer.  This is an enthusiast's brew with crossover appeal.  It is a bit hoppy for those not accustomed to craft beers but it's a controlled blast strong enough to get the job done without damaging surrounding structures.  It's just got that whack to it that makes you realize you are drinking a well designed well crafted set apart brew that emphasizes what's special about craft beer generally. 1

Smell-The smell is apricot dominant no doubt from the myrcene hops. There are also aromas of mango which is followed by a very biscuit malt backbone.  Taste-The taste follows the nose but I get the malts first which transform from biscuit into a caramel malt explosion. Then after a mild delay I get a splash of hop oils and slight bitterness to balance out everything. The whole experience is bursting with juicy fruits which are focused on tropical or citrus varieties. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and finishes with a lingering alpha acid coating on the tongue.   Overall-This is a great beer. Definitely is worth pouring into a nice glass.

This one always hits the spot for how balanced it is and drinkable with that extra smooth flavors. Michigan is one of my favorite beer states up there with Cali and Vermont in my book and this is a class of the state.  Other than 3 Floyds this is my go two back in the midwest.

It is actually very drinkable not quite as hoppy as most IPAs almost more like a Pale Ale.  It almost feels like it's a balance between an east coast and west coast IPA actually.

This beer has a nice golden and cloudy look to it which I like a lot. It also has a crisp and somewhat hoppy smell and taste. The aftertaste was a bit on the malty side for me though. Overall a good beer. I suspect Hemingway (Big Two-Hearted River) would approve.

Poured from the bottle into a pint glass this brew's head is two fingers thick with solid lacing and a clear golden amber body.      I smell a very fresh lively tangerine and white nectarine-bearing hops with a buttery cracker malt base.     Tastes like a very clean ever-so-slightly sweet blend of those fruits mentioned in the aroma with a zesty floral hop finish.      The mouthfeel is medium with mild carbonation. Again a very clean finish.     Overall I'll give Bell's Two Hearted Ale | Bell's Brewery Inc. a 4.75. I can't believe I took this long to discover the awesomeness that is this here beer.

I had it on tap the other night and I remembered it being more sweet and malty than what I was looking for at the time. drinking it now (90 degrees nyc unexpected downpour) I don't know whether I was any more perceptive of what was in this beer but I'm enjoying it more in any event.

Aroma was a light floral hops with a hint of malt. Sweet very light malt upfront with a pronounced hop bite on the end. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Overall an ok beer. I would not buy again as it is mire hoppy than what I prefer.

The first time I tasted it I wept. The only reason I didn't give this a perfect 5 is because I have to hold on hope that one day I will try a beer that is better than this.  Edit: Also I know a guy that knows a guy that knows the brewmaster at Bell's. He told me there are as much hops in 1 pint of Two-Hearted as there are in 7 and a half cases of Budweiser.

Long Lasting cream colored head with a buttery consistency. Smell: Sweet and fruity with notes of lemon-lime grape juice pineapple and cane sugar.  Barely any malt character.  Fairly one-note. Taste: Pretty balanced for an IPA.  It is actually conservative on the fruity character with some grapefruit and grape notes but it is bold on the hops and malts.    Feel: acidic punch with a wonderful full-bodied feel and nice mouth-coating malty finish.  For the strangest reason it reminded me of eating some excellent moist cornbread.

It was hoppy as with most IPA style beers but incredibly smooth.  The aftertaste almost seemed malty in some way.  The carbonation wasn't too strong - well-balanced.  Good down to the last drop.  I'd definitely get this one again.

M: Medium carbonation slight bitterness with a dry hoppy finish. O: Very good! I finally was able to pick up a 6 pack when I went through NY. I'll definitely buy more in the future. Reminds me a bit of "Sculpin" but with a better price tag ($11/6).

Drank from the can like an American.  This a a very hoppy first taste but finishes very softly with at topical aftertaste. Really good ipa and I am glad it's readily available to me.  I wish the alcohol % was a little higher but a very solid brew that I will be purchasing again.

It's an opaque amber-orange with an small off white head that laces mildly. On the nose I catch mango and pineapple or perhaps some other tropical fruits as well as a buttery toasted malt character that's subtle but balancing in it's effect. The taste follows. It's light and refreshing with some floral and tropical notes followed by some residual piny-ness that ends in a dry malty finish. Medium mouthfeel with medium-high carbonation. A superbly balanced and flavorful IPA. Quite possibly the best I've had so far.

White foamy head about a finger thick. Strong smell of citrus and pine followed by a little bread. Taste is citrusy leaning towards grapefruit following into a bit of pine and then finishes with a bready flavor. A little bit of malt to balance out the hops. Feel is light not quite a medium bodied beer floats about the mouth. Finishes quickly and cleanly a little lingering pine flavor that is kind of nice actually. While I wouldn't have this as a regular drinker for me it's certainly a pleasant beer that I wouldn't mind picking up from time to time.

Smells of caramel and biscuit malt with fresh grapefruit and pine hops.    Tastes of biscuit malts honey grapefruit pine resin and fresh fruity hops.    Medium to full body with tingly carbonation on the roof of the mouth.  Been drinking this for years and only just realized I'd never reviewed it.  Top notch IPA lots of love about this.  Great aroma great flavor great body.  The balance is perfect everything is pronounced but nothing is overwhelming.  One of the best IPAs you can get.

Not incredibly hop forward like a lot of new IPAs but very well balanced and a joy to drink.

Big tangerine peel and floral aroma wow.  Tastes like it smells but with a solid malt backbone.  Such a clean tasting brew with a mineraly quality.  Medium soft mouthfeel with crisp zesty grapefruit peel finish.  First time I've had this one in a while.  So glad Bells is here now in NOLA.

Smelled of citrus grapefruit and very hoppy. Tastes the same as it smelled.  Not a fan of IPA's.  Thought this was a different kind of Ale.  Was rather disappointed.

Thought I would give it a try. Bought a 4 pack of 16 oz. cans for $8.99.  L- Orange hazy color with a creamy 2 finger head. Head stuck around for a while some good lacing. Nice looking ipa. S- Smell hit as soon as I started pouring. Citrus grapefruit floral hop. Haven't had a lot of ipa's but I don't imagine they would smell much better than this. Very nice hoppy smell. T- Wow this is a flavorful beer. Taste follows spot on with nose citrus grapefruits pine. Not too bitter at all. F- Nice mouth feel for such a hoppy beer. It's heavy and strong but feels almost medium bodied. O- Well this was a very nice ipa. I don't prefer this type of beer but it was very enjoyable. A nice introduction into ipa's. If your looking for a ipa that's not too overwhelming check this out! Excellent beer worth the hype!

Taste follow with a bitter citrus peel flavor. Has a decent feel not watery or thick. Bitter is not my style of beer(got from my daughter see likes fruit ipas).But I've had worse.

The aroma is of apricot-like hop oils and sweet white bread. Taste is of those elements with pronounced but in now way harsh bitterness. Mouthfeel is high medium and Bell's Two Hearted Ale finishes dry and highly drinkable.   RJT

Now again this isn't my favorite style (far from it) but i could knock a couple of these two hearted babies every once in a while when I'm feeling hoppy.

It's perfectly balanced and sells really well for us. I am selling it in bottles but next time I would order it in a keg.

Perfectly balanced with just the right combination of bittering hops to malt sweetness.  Very full-flavored and aromatic.  I can't imagine an IPA fan not loving this beer.  This was one my early IPA discoveries and back in the day there weren't very many beers that could compare.  Two Hearted is just as good today as it ever was but maybe it doesn't stand out from the crowd quite as much as it once did just because of the sheer numbers of great IPAs out there.  Still a benchmark IPA as far as I am concerned.

It has the added plus that it's sold in my local Trader Joes where it is easily the best beer TJ carries ('Kilt Flasher' by Devil's Backbone Brewing is a close second within TJ's stock).

Still very strong hop presence and a smooth finish with not too sharp bitter aftertaste  F- Medium body O- Very smooth and great overall flavor. The back calls it an IPA yet the hops don't overpower the other flavors.

Lovely white head that retains fairly well and leaves behind rings of lacing. Resin and dank hops with tropical citrus notes make up a delectable aroma. Taste features pine and resin hops with floral and tropical citrus notes. Lovely and easy to drink. Mouth feel is smooth and easy going. A bit grainy at the end. Overall an easy going IPA that is pleasant to smell and most importantly drink.  Served in a 12oz snifter.

Mild well-balanced hops on the front end. Smooth on the back end and finishes slowly but with no lingering bitter aftertaste. If you aren't an IPA lover this beer will change that in one sip. An absolute masterpiece.

S:  Citrus rind a little bready malt some pine resin.  Really nice. T:  Matches the aroma exactly but some sweetness from the malt sneaks through.  Bitterness is evident but not harsh.  Very well done. F:  Body is medium.  Attenuated to the perfect FG.  Substantial but not heavy.  Dry finish but quenching.  Each sip begs another. O:  This is not outrageous over the top hoppy.  It's most definitely hop forward though.  The skill of the brewers is evident.  This is the standard all IPA's should be compared to.  The kicker for me is the little bit of malt sweetness that makes it through the layers of citrusy hops.  Excellent stuff.  Bottled 2/9/2016

It's a very very pleasant smell so different from most IPAs. It's like 50 % grapefruit 50 % tangerine and it smells so fresh... Well done Bell's this is a first for me. I've had peach pineapple grapefruit obviously even ginger/galanga but never tangerine. The taste is great as well very balanced very pleasant. Not as fruity it's more bitter and you taste the malts very well. I don't see the floral notes many are mentioning but I understand why it's become a classic.

Somewhat cloudy with some bubbles from the carbonation.  Smell: Notes of citrus pine hops and tropical fruit such as mango. There are also some floral and spruce notes (almost like sap).   Taste: Mildly bitter which is to be expected out of an American IPA. Has obvious citrus notes from the hops as well as a spruce/sap/pine flavor. It also has a crisp refreshing finish which is delicious. Overall the taste follows the nose really well.    Mouthfeel: Does not taste alcoholic at all. It is slightly carbonated which gives the beer its crisp feel. This beer is also fairly smooth and well balanced. The flavors work well together and create a delicious citrus aftertaste.   Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. It isn't overly bitter like a lot of IPAs are. The flavors work really well together. I would highly recommend this beer to those who want a flavorful beer that isn't sweet or overly bitter.

I've had it many times but after drinking two one right after the other I figured I'd give it a review. In appearance it has a dark solid gold orange color. Quarter inch thick head and lots of flavor. Easily one of the most refreshing APA's out there. It's got bold rich hoppy flavor at the onset and finishes cold and refreshing. A must have and an overall great beer.

A - Beautiful clarity honey colored backdrop offers a fine view of the stream of carbonation. The cap is off white and laced all the way. S - Malty floral hint of spearmint and orchid. Wonderful pine notes. T - Touch of deciduous sweet malt base is not overwhelming. a hop bite is quite nice. M - Solid body a bit slick at the onset with the carbonation cleaning up the end. O - A wonderful offering this could be a staple here if it was more widely available. Cheers all

It's a bottle conditioned ale with plenty of that robust piney flavor. This is my "Go to" beer if the selection is limited or if I'm just looking for a trusted favorite. I hold this Michigan favorite in high regard to all other IPA's.

The smell is piney citrus with and underlying sweetness. The taste is satisfyingly complex with layers of hoppy goodness supported by a perfectly subtle malty foundation underneath. The mouthfeel is clean and refreshing...a lovely ipa.

It pours a cloudy honey-orange color with a thick milk-white head and extensive lacing.  It has all the classic IPA smells:  pine needles grapefruit orange peel and floral hops and a whiff of caramel but the smells are rather subtle and not as dramatic as with some of the West Coast IPA's I've had.  While all the smells can be tasted I especially like the orange or tangerine.  There is lots of bitter hoppiness but the citrus is really refreshing.  This ale is medium-bodied moderately carbonated and with an ABV of 7% it's really drinkable.  It's refreshing and a really pleasant IPA to drink.  I understand and concur with its excellent rating.

This settles rather quickly into a thin layer over the beer with what look like little crop circles scattered everywhere!  The yeasty haze makes it too difficult to see what the carbonation appears to be and as for lacing well it is alright but eventually all of the small patches of foam slide back into the liquid nectar!  It looks alright overall just nothing special I guess.  S- Well this definitely smells of an IPA style Ale!  There are many aromas of heavy hop bitterness but blended into this are hints of malt sweetness that are become quite caramel like as it warms floral Earthy tones yeasty creaminess and lingering citrus fruits on the finish.  T- This is a very well balanced IPA and the flavors follow the nose rather well....the caramel sweetness is much more than I would have first guessed but balances the floral hop bitterness on the finish rather nicely....the citrus character shows itself more and more as this warms up towards room temperature and also gets creamier and more robust as time goes on....superb overall!  M/O- This is medium/full bodied in my opinion and where I thought this would be in terms of bitterness was surprisingly smooth and balanced...don't get me wrong there is plenty of bitterness but it is refined and doesn't overpower....this makes for a highly drinkable Ale.  This is also exquisite with Lindt Dark Lime Zest chocolate as an accompaniment.....I would buy this again but it isn't available in my area...I was lucky to get this in a trade some time ago....it holds up well against the ravages of time for your information!  Cheers! 1

This two hearted ale is everything I've heard about and more. Its 7.0 % but its taste like much less which is something I like from time to time with IPA. This isn't the most hoppy IPA but this beer would for sure get people into more IPA's

Smells less distinct than the West Coast hop bombs (love that strong smell) but is representative of a good IPA. Very good balance in taste between malt and the good hops. Light on carbonation aftertaste and feel on the tongue is just about perfect.  Hides its 7% ABV very well. Really a well-balanced IPA would be a great introduction to the style for a beginner.

For now my go-to beer.  This is (for my palate) much closer to a British pale ale or bitter vice the citrus and pine IPAs now ubiquitous here.    The pour looks to me again like a British pale ale a warm bronze-orange body with a tight ecru head dissipating to a ring.  I picture it on a worn oak bar--it's that familiar.  Smooth rich complex...it has it all.  The finish is stunning bursting with a crisp zing reminiscent of older famous eastern European pilsners.  How they pull that off and keep the mature bitter snap to it is beyond me but why analyze a sunset?  95 is a very high score but well deserved. If you factor in bang for your buck it's way closer to 100.  Next time I have it gonna make sure I have some serious pretzels.  That's the only thing this beer doesn't bring to the table.

It's a beer I have often and have respect for because of it's consistency.  This smells of citrus and an overall floral bouquet some lavender is there which I find unique to two hearted ale.  It tends to the floral side and less to the tropical fruit and resin of a west coast style IPA but hints of these are in the nose however.  That being said the taste is refreshingly bitter with a pleasant presence of malt not sweet but truly balanced.  It is a remarkable beer for what it is year in and year out.  I can taste a slight variation in the hop profile between batches but the floral component is always there.  It's a classic ale that I will always gravitate towards when I want something familiar and simply good. It's not a flavor bomb but subtle and floral like the difference between a French Sancerre and California Sauvignon Blanc in wine terms.  It's more subtle and nuanced for an IPA and that makes it worthy of being a classic always welcome in my fridge. 1

THA was 7.0% alcohol by volume.  THA poured a slightly hazy amber/orange colour topped by 2” of orange-tinged off-white head. The head gradually faded to a central blob of foam leaving some sporadic lacing down the glass. Its aroma was a mix of grapefruit lemon orange and caramel. The taste was a good balance between the sweetness of the caramel malts and the combination of sweet tropic fruits (papaya orange) and bitter citrus flavours from the hops (lemon grapefruit). THA had a mildly bitter finish and a short-lived aftertaste that did not overstay its welcome. The beer had a soft carbonation fell on the light side of light/medium bodied and had a creamy mouthfeel. Good work minions! A refreshing beer that I would certainly quaff again.

Canned on December 27th 2016 so a touch on the old side.  Still one of my classic go-to beers and the first IPA I ever had.  This beer will always hold a special place in my heart.    L: Slightly hazy golden color with a dense rocky head of off-white coloration at a two and a half finger head.  Incredible retention.    S: Rich citrus hop aroma consisting of grapefruit and orange super juicy smelling.  A floral grassy note and some light toasted malts in the character of doughy biscuits.    T: Just a wonderfully juicy IPA with grapefruit and orange citrusy notes to start with.  Then it takes on this more floral grassy side which turns into a faint yeasty note mostly covered by doughy biscuity malts.  Really a superbly complex IPA with a nice hop bite.    F: Light-Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation and some drying finish.   O: This is an American IPA classic brew.  Hits all the marks perfectly.  Next time I visit Bell's I will be having this on draught for sure. 1

Excellent example of a east coast IPA.  Not as big a hop hit as some and not quite as fruity/juicy as NE or Treehouse offerings but a very tasty brew just the same.  Super easy to drink - I could crush a bunch of these. Will def pick up again.  Very enjoyable cheers.

Light citrus nose with a little grassy hops. Lite citrus flavor gentle bitter hops caramel malt; lite lemon grass finish. Moderate carbonation; medium lite mouthfeel. Lite lemon grass linger. 
1296,/beer/profile/287/1093/,4.29,look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75,ctylinebeer, oz bottle poured into an IPA glass. Little past the sell buy date but have had this on draft before.   L - golden amber color with a cloudy hue. Nice thick foam dome. Thin layer of foam on top. Lacing gripping the glass  S - bitter but floral aroma. Pine dominates  T - crisp pine and citrus taste. Soft bitterness turns into a very bitter aftertaste.   F - thick in body definitely not watery. Hops affect the clean finish but quite crisp actually.   O - certainly one of the mainstream IPAs  in the market. Best selling Bell's from my store. Great craft brewery though. Give this to someone who has never had a bitter beer before.

Lots of big flavors of tropical and citrus fruits in the smell and taste really well balanced as far as sweetness and bitterness. The feel is crisp refreshing and smooth. Definitely one of the best IPAs out there.

Not balanced out by malts at all but then again it shouldn't be.  M - light to medium alcohol is covered  aftertaste is grapefruit and orange peel  O - great beer from my home state!

Nice two finger foamy head that lingers leaves a beautiful thick lacing down the glass. Plenty of tiny small bubbles streaming up the pint glass. AROMA: Lots of grapefruit orange and apricot. A sugary floral note. TASTE: Basically just like the smell. Sweet and bitterness nicely balanced with a nice mild lasting bitterness on the back end. MOUTHFEEL: Very FRESH feel...crisp smooth medium body and carbonation dry finish. OVERALL: Stellar IPA. Not overly bitter but you know it's there. Find fresh bottles or from the tap to get the most out of it.

Smell: It has aromas of citrus apricots and pine.  Taste: It has flavors of citrus and apricots. There are some caramel flavors that provide the malt flavoring.  Feel: It is a light medium bodied brew with a moderate bitterness that lingers a while on the palate.  Overall: This is a moderately bitter IPA with fruity flavors and a bit of malt that is well balanced.

Super amber color with a little haze. You can smell and taste the citrus combo in this amazing beer. Super easy drinking with the perfect amount of carbonation. A very balanced hoppy flavor. This is a "go to" beer for sure. To say something  let alone a beer  is perfect  is far fetched but this beer is dam close. After the Christmas eve party with family and friends I was psyched to find 4 left in the fridge ! This beer went well with Christmas dinner the next day !!!  A solid go to beer that is fairly priced for an amazing product !

Orange amber chill haze heaping voluminous mounds of large dense bubbly foam leaving spongy lace.  There is a pretty definitive showcase of grapefruit on the nose as well as pine. This is a classic after all.  In taste I get pine first then grapefruit. Toasty malt come in to support the hops at a moderate level.  Finish is pretty dry and bitter. Revisiting this beer many times I easily realize how much this would have turned me off long ago. I was not one of the many who find IPAs most approachable then move on to darker beers. IPAs were my arch enemy and this was one of my most hated. But not I can see how well made and consistent this brew really is.  I have also had this on cask When on cask I get notes of amaretto some sort of delicate flower and passionfruit. On cask these flavors are most prominent with almost no bitterness to detect and an unbelievably smooth texture to the point I wonder if it's a beer especially IPA at all.  The vast differences between the cask and the standard versions of this beer or so drastic it's unreal and I'm not sure which I prefer more because the cask is also odd in its own way and the warmth doesn't help. 1

A very drinkable beer at a good price.  It's biggest issue is maybe a lack of complexity.  That seems to be all that's missing to make this a favorite.

Furthermore dissipates quickly leaving some nice lace on the sides.  Appearance is a bit cloudy dark orange in color.  Mouth fell is good nice body leading to smooth finish.  Smell is lightly floral and not a bit overpowering or and does not creep back into the nasal passage.  Taste is mild Pitney flavor with a honey buttery note to it. Overall a great beer.

As for an American IPA this brew has perfect balance of aroma's and flavor. Not too much of anything. If you are looking for a perfect representation and great tasting (not to mention a very nice mouthfeel) drink TWO HEARTED

I am an avid fisherman that would love to fish the St Mary's River most of the time. After a good night of catching my limit I'd almost always love to stop at the local corner store and buy a sixer of this. The sixer wouldn't last less two days back then. And that was for a reason. Always in a pint glass never any other beer glass this had the appearance of a ruddy bronzed earthy brown to orange color with a one finger level foamy white head. Strings of lacing slid down the glass enroute to the beer in a nonchalant way. The smell takes in earthy to floral to spicy hops combining over a light basic caramel malt. The taste wraps together the hops and the malts to be a purely blissful bittersweet flavor. Faint combination of flavors in the aftertaste and a charming wet finish. The mouthfeel grasped a nice sessionably sweet stickiness to slide over my tongue yet still telling me "don't pound me treat me right please sip." With that in mind carbonation rides fairly light in this beer allowing the nuances of the aromas to come together wonderfully. Overall do you think I don't miss this beer? If I still lived in its distro a sixer of this would always accommodate my fridge. Its the IPA that got me into IPA's and craft beer. 1

Not an over-the-top hoppy bitterness.  Leaves a nice after taste.    Not much more to say. This is a great IPA.  I will definitely add this to the top of my "to buy again" list.

Consumed on 10Nov15. LOOK: Pours with a finger and half worth of white foam that dissipates into a half finger's worth after 45 seconds. Honey orange in color.  There is a large amount of both small and medium-sized rising bubbles. Lacing is high in quantity and both thick and think I'm various areas.  SMELL: There are mild aromas of buttered bread that meet with mild piney hop aromas subtle aromas of gummy fruit snacks and hints of alcohol. TASTE: Initial taste is of strong piney hops that are immediately followed by mild buttered bread flavors. Subtle gummy fruit snack flavors enter next. Subtle bitter hop flavors enter lastly as all previous flavors persist. FEEL: Medium-bodied and subtly carbonated. Goes down smooth and creamy. Finishes with a strong dryness. NOTE:  I wasn't getting any citrus or floral flavors which surprised me. The beer wasn't that fresh either so that may have been a reason why. This was a pretty great IPA for being 3 months old. I can't wait to try a more fresh one. 1

Deep hazy golden orange/amber with a large 2-finger pillowy head that fully lasting and left plenty of lacing.   S: Crisp with lots of spicy floral and earthy hops. Some grapefruit.  T: Very hop forward but with just enough carmel malts to calm the bitterness. The hops follow the nose - floral spicy and a little bit earthy.  F: Crisp soft and medium bodied.  O: Delicious. Balanced crisp - truly wonderful. Would recommend and will be buying much much more.

1510,/beer/profile/287/1093/,4.09,look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25,draheim,Re-reviewing this one as my last review was 4 years old.  12oz (bottled 9/22/2015) into a tulip. Pours a beautiful glowing golden orange w/ a nice billowing white head.  Aroma is a nicely balanced blend of citrusy and floral hops. Notes of orange and spice.  Taste is likewise a nice citrusy floral hop combo on top of a blend of pale and caramel malts. A touch of malty sweetness tempered by alpha acid bitterness. Yeast lends it a vaguely Belgian tang.  Mouthfeel is balanced and medium bodied. Again the yeast gives it a softness not typical of most American IPAs. Nicely satisfying.  Overall a solid relatively complex well crafted balanced IPA. Would be a go-to if available locally.

Pouring into a nonic pint glass shows this beer as a slightly hazy amber color with a decent head minimal lacing.   Nice aroma of sweet malts and an oily and resinous hoppiness. Good flavor profile. VERY smooth and easy to drink bready malts orange zest resin slight pine quick sweetness near the end. Body is super light and this IPA is drinkable. Not the hoppiest but super crisp and easy to quaff.

Usually the term "balanced" is code for not hoppy here in California. But this is balance perfected. Great hop profile very smooth malt backing.  One of if not the best balanced ipas I've had

ABV: 7.0%  A: Hazed golden amber creamy dense head that both lasts and laces (even in a pint paper cup).  S: Apricot orange zest dried grass crackers  grapefruit esters fruity yeast.  T: Creamy smoothness that follows the fruit mix aroma with oily hoppiness and an autumnal ripe leafy orangey bready nutty yeasty peppery and floral long story. Finishes in a semi-pungent bitterness   F: medium bodied peppery dry finish classic creamy feel.

O - hope I'm not under rating - similar beers are often overpowered with pine or malt - this is very drinkable and well 'balanced' - we need a synonym...

Smell is citrus with plenty of floral/vegetal complements - makes me think that the hops used were very fresh.  Taste veers more towards the piney bitter end.  Dry finish and moderate carbonation make this an easy drinker that hides its ABV well.  Overall a classic IPA - long live Bell's Two Hearted!

The high IBU rating (around 75 I believe) is deceptive as this is a nicely balanced not particularly bitter beer. I'd still prefer an Ithaca Flower Power but I found this to be a pleasant and easy drinking beer that I would have again.

There is an ample almost velvety head that sticks around a good long while.  Very citrussy in scent but more toward the grapefruit end of the spectrum as opposed to tangerine or orange.  The front end is an almost grassy flavour followed by more grapefruit and notes of lemon.  There is a nice bitterness.  It sits light on the tongue much lighter than most IPAs which I actually prefer.

Nice frothy and creamy head with nice sticky lacing.  Aroma: Lots of citrus fruit.  Hints of grapefruit and quite a bit of lemon/lemon peel.  Taste: As with the aroma lots of citrus grapefruit and lemon.  Very nice bitterness balances it out at the end with a little malt at the end.  Feel:  Tastes a lot smoother than some of the IPAs I've had and it has pretty light mouth feel.    Overall:  Really nice IPA definitely recommend it.  Glad it came to Denver for a week.

Definite grapefruit on nose and taste with slight sweet tropical undertones.  A very well made beer that certainly rivals the smoothness and drink ability of west coast standard such as Sculpin.  I wish it was  distributed to the bay area.

It's easy to drink (smooth) and refreshing. The reason why I say it's been the best so far is because they don't try to spice it up much if you know what I mean. Its like they took a larger (pick your favorite one) and put in a machine where slightly amped the malt to like a 3/5 and the hops to about the same. So in other words imo it's well balanced. The only reason why I don't give this beer a five is because it's a little expensive compared to others when it seems like most ipa should be like this but somehow they go and funk it up and make something undrinkable. K.I.S.S.

Not my favorite hop smell but it smells pretty good here  Taste:  pithy grapefruit bitterness right up front and dominates through until the end; finishes with a dry hoppy aftertaste; I prefer European hops but this tastes pretty good overall  Mouthfeel:  creamy but thinner than I expected for the ABV  Remarks:  great example of the style

I've had a few bottles in my life but I hadn't really taken my time to appreciate this beer in proper glassware. Poured into my spiegelau IPA glass the color was an orange-yellow with a nice solid foam head that hung around for a little and then faded to a coating with decent lacing. Initial burst of floral with hints of citrus and then a sweet malt backdrop. Incredibly drinkable and with the perfect balance of hoppy bitterness and sweet malt. Great level of carbonation and finish the layer of citrus that coats your tongue on the way through is awesome.

Smells of lemon and honey and malt. Taste follows smell with lemon and honey tapering to malt. Feel is great. Slightly creamy think. Finishes smooth and malty. Got this beer on a trip to Alabama. Would keep all the time if I could get it in my part of Texas. Great beer.

Pretty in the glass clear copper glory pillowy foam stop. Good carb levels. Befitting bitterness levels. A well deserving standard bearer of the style.

Smooth and rich full flavored.  M=Medium body with moderate carbonation.   O= Good balance and tasty easy to drink would drink multiple.  Not a world-changer but a good go-to.

Pours a one finger head that dissipates quickly but leaves a good amount of lacing.  Aroma- Juicy hop aromas with sweet citrus peach and mango.  Some malt sweetness but the hops dominate.  Taste- Follows the nose closey with juicy hops up front that yield mild bitterness. The malt is balanced between caramel sweetness and bready malts adding dryness in the finish.  Feel- Medium bodied medium carbonation and a sweet/clean finish.  Overall- This would be a go-to if it were in my distro.  Great balance between juicy hops and sweet/dry malts.  A top tier ipa for sure that definitely competes with the best ipas.

Slight haze.  Smell - Sweet candied orange very floral hints of grapefruit and dankness  Taste - Super floral orange touch of grapefruit touch of dankness sweet malts very balanced very easy drinking  Feel - Medium body sticky mouthfeel not much bitterness at all dry finish  Overall - I personally prefer my IPAs more on the tropical fruit/citrus side as opposed to sweet and floral but this is a damn good quality IPA to say the least. I can see what the fuss is about...

A - Cloudy orange with golden highlights.   Two finger fluffy white head.   S - Citrus/orange heavy.  Biscuit and malt.  Hops (pine) on the finish.   T - Similar to the nose.  Based on the age the malts are more present than the hops  in relation to some previous hads.But it is still balanced and tasty.   M - Carbonation is medium low mouthfeel is creamy.   O - One of my favorite IPAs.  This held up well even though it was in a  warm can and should be included in IPA 101 for anyone starting out with the style.

Pretty lacing. Fairly active carbonation. Color is a hazy amber-copperish.  Smell: Floral citrus hops. Blood or mandarin oranges. Undertones of biscuit.  Taste: Orange citrus up front. Biscuit malts on the mid palate. Piney bitter finish. Supremely well balanced. Fairly complex.  Feel: Medium body and carbonation. Slightly sticky. Delightfully crisp.  Overall: Pretty dang great. Every ingredient is in near perfect balance and has a plesant citrus hop profile. This one's a win for me. I think I like Fresh Squeezed from Deschutes just a little bit more but this one is right up there.

It has a very hoppy grassy aroma. Tastes of hops the air in a pine forest and more hops. Was going to rate taste 4.25 but the amazing aftertaste changed my mind so bitter and wonderful. Tried this several months back and didnt really appreciate it until now. Fantastic ipa.

It is a nice clear yellow / gold color.  It remains quite effervescent and continues to lace after the head fades out.  Smell: Very strong fruity floral hop scents and tartness.  There is a slight tart aroma as well.  Taste: There is an immediate hop bitterness that bursts out at first.  Soon after the initial bite a smooth and sweet yeasty taste fades in.  This is a rich malty and fruity flavor that doesn't stick around for long as there is another phase of hop tartness and a very full floral rush followed by a dry finish.  Feel: This beer has a low-medium body that has a medium dryness on the tongue.  Overall: This is a great and I mean great IPA.  I didn't believe the hype about this beer as it is one of the top rated IPAs around.  I grew up in Michigan and never had any of Bell's beers when I lived there (very sad now) but am glad to have tasted a few on my trip to visit family.  I would definitely buy this (and even order online and have it shipped) as I think this is what an IPA should taste like.  Its not crazy bitter (IBU) or overwhelmingly floral-hoppy but a great all around full flavored and well balanced IPA. 1

Not a power hop aroma T-orange caramel flavors followed by grass hoppiness peppery and finish somewhat dry. Very balance smooth and easy to drink M-medium body medium carbonation O-this is a very balance and smooth drinking ipa. However was expecting more based on the ratings. I guess I'm getting used to hop bombs & thought this was slightly above average beer.

Aroma has subtle hop hints the taste follows the nose and its rewarded with hops. A light bodied beer with a decent amount of carbonation. A well balanced well made beer.  A good beer from a consistent brewery.

Purchased while in Niagara Falls New York. Given the reputation that precedes this beer I had to try it. Appears to have been packaged June 8 2015 so this is nearly a couple months old.  Appearance - A medium pour yielded a cloudy coppery beer with a plethora of sediment gently floating in space within the beer and capped by a finger and change of light white fluffy head. Modest retention but  some of the lacing sticks to the glass leaving behind a cobwebbed pattern.  Smell - Very citrus  pineapple and tangerine being the primary culprits. A wack ton of sugary caramel oozes in behind. a slight spicy lemony note finishes things up.  Taste - Actually starts quite earthy with some leaps and musty hops the kind that usually pair well with grapefruit. That's followed by some increasing sweetness where the tangerines and pineapple come to play before finish with a more bitter turn. There's some caramel flavors in there which pop up as the beer flavors transition provide something smooth and quite tasty. A coarse crackery grain flavor is the tailing flavor on a few sips as the beer warms even more.  Mouthfeel - Prickly carbonation and a drier than average finish oilier than other IPA's but it works here making this a smooth drinking beer.  Overall - A damn good IPA that just about lives up to its reputation as being one of the best. I'd prefer even more tropical citrus punch (which may have been eveident with a fresher can) but even still a high quality IPA that was worth the purchase. Definitely a must try for IPA fans and hop lovers alike. 1

A moderate to big aroma with a nice blend of floral citrus and tropical hops.  Flavor is similar blend of hops with a really nice malt balance.  Good middle bitterness which finishes clean.

A nice amber color with a malty citrus aroma.  The beer has a good start in the taste department with malt in the front and the hops in the back.  Even carbonation and well balanced.  Overall a very drinkable IPA.

I waited to review to make sure I wasn't influenced by the novelty.    On this occasion - enjoying our of a 16 ounce can.  Look - n/a  Smell - despite being tamed by the can the smell is delicious.   a perfect balance of bready malt and floral/citrusy hops.  Taste - consistent with smell.   I have traditionally been an advocate of hop forward beers but this balance blows me away.  Malt complements hop perfectly.    Mouth feel - medium with good carbonation.  despite a relatively high abv for ipa's very drinkable.  Overall -  Outstanding.   moves to the top of my fall-back list now that it is readily available.    It's like Christmas in July.

This beer converted my wife from porters and stouts to IPAs.  Now she likes IPAs as her go to.  It was her gateway.    Beautiful orange colored pour with a white foam head.  Huge fruity nose one of the best around.  The aroma really sets it apart especially when its fresh.  Taste is more on the malty side of the IPA spectrum.  Its hoppy but not overly hopped up.  Very drinkable you could certainly drink two of these back to back and be happy.

Anyway pours a translucent - almost but not quite clear - orange/amber with a finger and a half of soft white head. Strong floral aroma closely followed by a similar taste in the tongue with a little peach to round things out along with perfect bitterness. Great mouthfeel and definitely a deserving legend of the IPA category. Only thing that keeps it from being a 5 is that it might could use a little more complexity but it is still excellent.

Not a bad beer by any means but I guess I was expecting something a lot more hop-forward.  This is the second out-of-state single IPA I've tried and was let down by this one.  Would try again if I could verify freshness.  The other one was Smuttynose finestkind and that one was great.  Still hard to go with any out of state IPA option since we have so so many options for local fresh ones in CA.

Aroma yields floral hops big citrus some tropical fruits big mango/papaya sweetness and a kiss of lemony pine.  Taste is a kick of pine bitterness up front. This is followed by the hop floralness some citrus (mainly grapefruit rind) and a prevalent malt back bone.   The beer is overall very well rounded. However I do prefer less pine bitterness in my beers. I like more tropical fruits. Still a very good standard. I see this pairing well with a spicy goat stew. It gets a 90/100.

This one from Bell's is different it's definitely hoppy but has enough malt to let you focus on the taste instead of the bitterness.  Grapefruit and maybe just a bit of sour orange mix in together to make this a very refreshing beer.  Perfect summer sipping beer. Beautiful golden/orange color very nice head and lacing and as I said not so bitter that it kills the flavors like some IPA's do. This is the first beer I've had from Bell's in Maryland but will be trying more after this was recommended by one of the bartenders at the local bar I frequent. They are having a night featuring Bell's next week so looking forward to seeing what else they brew.

Heady hazy orange-amber pour.  Those tropical tangerine orange and fruit esters on the nose are remarkable even for a 3 month old bottle.  I wish I had a fresher one.  I'd probably be spellbound.  Good medium to full body.  The taste has the same amazing fruit characteristics but it all comes together with an almost sinus-cleaning bitterness that lingers dryly at the end.  This one deserves the high ratings it gets.  The tropical fruit aroma and taste really penetrates it all.

It does not rely to heavily on hops while also not holding back giving just enough to bring out the malt and hop in it.

This pours a hazy deep orange with a thick puffy white head.  Leaves nice lacing on the glass.  Smells very juicy and citrusy.

It pours a nice golden color backed by a present hop aroma.  This American IPA is very well balanced. The ABV and hop ratio works in bringing out the bitterness and malt character.

This is what an IPA should smell like strong hops and floral smell. However I was greatly disappointed in the taste it lacked bitterness. It is very smooth but it only smells like an IPA and doesn't not taste like one. I'll never drink this again. From the smell you think your having a great bitter IPA when it's actually extremely smooth.

It pours to a giant white rocky head (pour carefully!) that sits astride a pale amber sparkling beer muted by a promising chill haze. The sticky head leaves lots of beautiful lacing in its wake. The nose is a strong sublime blend of citrus florals and resinous pine with boozy undertones. The flavor hops carry through to the palate over top of a malty foundation that gets washed over by a nice hoppy bitterness. This bitterness dominates the finish clinging as it should for the style joined by hints of bitter citrus and pine. The bitterness is very well-balanced relative to the flavor being less heavy-handed than in a lot of IPAs. The fizzy carbonation is a nice counterpoint to the bitterness and sets the medium body up for a slight creaminess that increases drinkability. (16 oz can 32 days after pkg.)

Great carbonation and lacing as well. Smell is floral and citrusy with some bready malt. Taste is similar to the smell and very well balanced. Feel is medium the beer is very crisp. I am a hop head by nature so overall I would say this is a good IPA. I can see why people rate it as highly as they do bc it is exceptionally well balanced while still showcasing the great hop aroma and taste but personally it is not my favorite take on the style.

Nice floral nose with a light lingering bitter finish. There is a good balance of malt in this beer as well. It is a very good gateway IPA for those who have not yet had a great IPA.

For the sake of this one had on tap at Greenfield Village in Dearborn MI. Sipped while walking around slices of Americana. Even the plastic cup couldn't detract from this beauty. The color is golden orange with a thick solid head that stays put. Thick juicy mouthfeel deep grapefruit and floral aroma. Taste is malty grapefruit with pine bite on the end. Hands down one of the best out there.

Crystal clear amberish golden in the glass.  Smell is all pineapple and citrus great aroma.  Taste is initially sweet malt caramel followed swiftly by pineapple and citrus and closes out with a mild bitterness.  One word here balance​.  Very drinkable easy on the palate.  First time I have had it on tap.

Fairly malty too.  A little too malty for me but this is what most folks call "balanced".  I wish more of the non-bitter hop flavors came through.  Citrus rind on the finish.  Pretty highly carbonated.  Not too light or too heavy.  I should have tried this sooner.  For a beer you can find most anywhere it's pretty good.

Smells of citrus hoppy sweetness. Taste is amazing not too strong but has enough to keep you interested. Smooth after taste not bitter at all. Finishes like a champ easily drinkable over and over again. Cheers

A: Pours a hazy golden-rod honey with a thick white head. Good retention and solid lacing. Beautiful to look at.  S: Grapefruit citrus orange peel cracker and resiny pine hop aromas all come through. This beer smells fantastic.   T: Grapefruit lemon citrus cracker pine smooth hop spice and crisp bitter finish. Incredibly delicious and easy drinking.  M: Medium bodied slightly oily fair amount of carbonation smooth slightly dry and overall incredibly satisfying on the finish.  O: My favorite ever day beer. Truly a solid brew in every sense. I would rank this with Ballast Point's Sculpin as my favorite readily available IPA.

Pours a semi-clear amber color while smelling of hops with a light malt/citrus smell. Deliciously bitter (oxymoron?) while managing to not be overpowering nor being a complete hop-bomb. This is a very good and well crafted representation of the style and I will DEFINITELY be picking this up again. Like god damn.

Color is a faintly hazy orange-gold topped by a two-finger rocky white head.  Lacing is very good.  Aroma is hoppy  as expected with bright citrus-grapefruit and evergreen notes with bread-y malts hovering in the back.  Taste starts with a rich malt front- caramel and biscuit- that is followed by assertive hop bitterness.  The sweetness of the malts and the citrus-rind hops compliment each other very well with peppery notes and subtle fruity esters coming in from the background. The finish is dry and pine-y.  Tremendously well-balanced throughout; even as the beer warms in the glass the hops somehow never become obnoxious.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied smooth and slightly oily with fairly vigorous carbonation.  Just substantial enough while being easy to drink.  I've been hearing for years how amazing this beer is but until now it hadn't been available in my area.  So when I happened to see it for sale (in my local Food Lion no less) giving this one a try was an imperative.  I was prepared for disappointment... but for once all the hype was totally justified.  For me IPA's are are hit or miss- when they're done right they're great but when even a little wrong they're terrible one-dimensional hop-bombs.  This beer definitely gets it right:  All of the strong hop notes that an IPA should have are there but they live in perfect harmony with wonderful caramel malts and fruity yeast flavors.  Even those who normally eschew IPA's should at least give this one a try- it's a remarkable beer that's the standard for what an American IPA should be. 1

The smell is loaded with orange grapefruit and pine hops.  There is a thick malty bready backbone with some caramel as well.   The taste follows the nose with grapefruit orange and pine hops dominating; it feels kind of like drinking a pine cone. Pine hop oil is left on the tongue after swallowing.  The caramel malt backbone is present from start to finish and complements the hops. The feel is bready but also a little oily. I would recommend this to someone who has not tried an IPA and was wondering if they would like this style.

S - Grapefruit citrus soggy woodland soil and grass.  T - Resiny woody hop flavors bloom out from the front. Very earthy and herbal gradually fading into a more juicy citrusy flavor. Almost 'soaked' tasting. The citrus hangs powerfully in the residual taste.  M - Fairly light body very juicy with a decent carbonation.  O - I can see why this is often considered the archetype of the IPA. Has all the major American hop flavors rolled into one and with a very middle-of-the-road crispness and bitterness.

I didn't get any fruity notes from this beer so it was a nice change from many of the overly floral and fruity IPA's crowding the shelves today.

This is single hopped. It has centennials hops with a malt background. It is the largest single purchaser for Bell's. It is 100% centennial hops.

Generous off white head that stayed for a while and left nice tracks. Aroma was big citrus with an hint of malt. Taste followed suit with beautiful citrusy Centennial hops and a nice malt backbone. Dry finish. a beautiful beer. 
2292,/beer/profile/287/1093/,4.13,look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25,apokatastasis,Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Light opaque amber in colour; average head with decent retention. Bubbly splotches of lacing which slowly dribbles their way down.   Aroma: Citrus and floral definitely very hoppy but with more delicate hops than the usual dose of bitterness (appearance reflects this).   Taste: Follows the nose to a large degree with a lot of grapefruit character but here we catch also a healthy hop bitterness  and malt sweetness in the background. All throughout the floral quality is obvious enhancing every aspect of the beer and giving it a very refined flavour.  Mouthfeel: Light with moderate carbonation and a slight oiliness. Long bitter aftertaste which leaves the mouth dry.   Overall: This beer is decidedly floral and I love that. To me in the world of such an over-saturated market as IPA the only ones which are worthwhile are things which bring something new to  the palette and the delicate nature of this IPA - from the appearance to the mouthfeel - certainly delivers. 1

No other way to put it besides that this is how a beer should look. Head leaves heavy lacing.  Aroma: Citrus Floral Slighty Sweet. Not a very strong aroma overall though.  Taste: Being used to West Coast IPAs this beer didn’t have the kick that I am always ready for. Was actually a really well balanced beer though. Sweet orange and grapefruit flavor that follows the nose and you really get a floral hoppy backbone. Smooth. Not overpowering.  Feel: No doubt that this is a very smooth beer. Medium viscosity and just the right level of carbonation  Overall: Was a really great IPA that I have always wanted to try. Was disappointed with the nose but all other aspects of the beer made up for it. A great beer that I wouldn’t hesitate to buy again.  EDIT: Nose opened up ALOT as beer warmed. Still did not impress. But worth of some more points

Lacing was steady and constant all the way to the end.  Aroma of hops pine and a beautiful floral citrus.  Taste is simple with a mix of citrus strong pine and hop bitterness.  Easy drinking and nice bite on the palate.  Bell's has concocted a real nice IPA here well done!

LOOK: A slightly hazy rusty gold with a huge fluffy white head that recedes to a thin but lasting film and that leaves pretty lacing all the way down the glass.  SMELL: A simple but refreshing hop aroma.  You can definitely tell it's all Centennial.  Very floral and a balance of citrus and pine.  TASTE: A small burst of piney hops upfront.  Smooth grapefruit taste and a hint of orange peel.  The hearty sweet malt backbone comes through on the mid-palate giving it body and then it finishes slightly dry with a smack of juicy citrus and pine.  Extremely drinkable.  FEEL: Medium-bodied with medium carbonation.  Juicy and slightly dry.  Overall: I love it!  Expecting a world-class beer I was unimpressed by this beer the first time I had it but the beauty of this beer is its simplicity.  It's no hop bomb but it's smooth balanced and endlessly drinkable.  This is the type of beer you could drink every day and not get sick of.  Thank you so much Bell's!  I'll be purchasing much more of this in the future! 1

Pleasantly rich smell and appearance full complex taste not overly bitter or grapefuity like so many IPAs leans towards piney but still fresh and satisfying.

Reviewing for first time on the occasion of my first time pouring it from a 16 oz. can. Then and now I find it an almost perfect brew. It's hearty in its hop consistent in body from initial mouthful to finish great flavor in its mix of floral and pine and very smooth. It's very worthy of its standard-setting rep. Delicious.

This is one of my go-to beers when I can't decide or don't feel like trying something new.  It's probably not going to win over the real hopoholics but still a very nice smooth beer.  I feel like it may be closer to an APA vs. an IPA but we're splitting hairs there.  The 7% is well-hidden which can sneak up on you as these can go down quickly.

Reviewed 10-18-14. (Re-reviewed 6-15-15 and 9-12-15).  Appearance:  Medium-light copper 1/2" off-white head.  Very good retention and excellent lacing.    Aroma: Resiny piny hops.  Some grapefruit rind but not really a fruity IPA.  [Sweet citrus pine sap sweet malt. hearty.]  Taste: Dry [recent bottle was quite sweet compared to the likes of Columbus IPA Finestkind and White Rajah] bitter [just about as] malty [as] the nose clean finish.  Mouthfeel: Thinner than I expected; [solidly mid bodied clean finishing not too slick] ample carbonation.  Overall: This was probably my first IPA and is one I return to over and over.  It is reliably a quality beer but nothing about it ever knocks my socks off.  Just a good bitter balanced reliable IPA.  I am not a hop head and love this IPA; 7% is utterly hidden malts are present and almost in balance.  I will buy this beer again and again. [Ditto.] 1

A: Grapefruit right on the nose slight pine no alcohol.   T: Like the nose grapefruit citrus bitterness slight pine strong malt presence on the backend pretty balanced bitterness lingers.  M: More than a medium mouthfeel heavier than any IPA I have ever tried finishing dry.  O: Pretty good for an IPA this is really balanced I was expecting more hops but the hop characteristics are fleeting then you get a nice malt presence on the backend. Very juicy I like my IPAs with a little more bite at the front I would not pass this beer up but I think there are better IPAs especially in California.

As such this is probably the craft beer I drink most often. I consider it my old standby. Can't decide? In a hurry? Want to catch a buzz quick? Two hearted is always a good choice.  It is quite hoppy but crisp and delicious. The high ABV will catch up with you but maybe that's one of the reasons it's so appealing?

First time lives it but every time I have tried it since then it disappoints. I don't understand the hype. Did not seem well balanced at all. Just slightly boozy and earthy bitterness. Aroma was ok - maybe slightly floral. And I love IPAs. I'd probably give it another chance if offered but I won't pay for it again. There are much better IPAs out there. 
2458,/beer/profile/287/1093/,4.19,look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25,mchegash,Appearance - 4/5 Cloudy orange with several fingers of slightly off-white head.  Smell - 3.75/5 Slightly sweet pine aroma with hints of resin  Taste - 4.5/5 Pine hops but well-balanced with the malts making this a very well-balanced IPA.  Mouthfeel - 4/5 Medium bodied. Medium amount of light-medium intensity carbonation.  Overall - 4.25/5 Truly a great IPA.

A: Pours a rich golden color with a white foamy head.  S: Floral with a hint of apple. No change in smell over time.  T: Floral again but not overly hoppy and again some apple notes are noticed.  M: Medium body and heavier than I would imagine from the sight and smell. No real alcohol flavor from the 7.0% ABV either. 	  D: No surprises here in flavor. It tastes just like it smells with no complex layers that I can discern. I don’t say that in a bad way though. The beer wasn’t heavy but heavier than I imagined and it rounds off the fruity taste nicely.

Off-white head blend of fine & big bubbles.  Not a big bouquet which suits me fine. Nothing off about it. Hints of apricot.  Really nice flavor. Big hit of bitter apricots. Finish is nice but not especially long. I drink double IPAs 4:1 over single so I had to moderate my expectations there.  Lovely mouthfeel. Moderately rich.  This beer comes together will great integrity more than the sum of its parts. I'd always be happy drinking one of these.

It is very drinkable to the point of almost being scary at 7% abv. I never cared for the super bitter beers which is typical in an IPA. I just wish there were more IPA's like this.

Aroma of sharp hops with touches of ripe tropical fruits and lemon.  Flavor is assertively hoppy and if this is what you want you got it.  The taste is similar to the scent but with a lot more resin influence riding on a solid malt base.  Very complex group of flavors that work well together.  Full texture with balancing carbonation.  It has a lot of hop flavor I'll give it that.  Overall a hallmark beer.

Where is the malts to match the intense bitter hops. Anybody that thinks ballast point sculpin makes for a smooth and pleasant drinking IPA is dumber than a box of rocks. D- (60-64)

Very smooth while drinking ABV kicks in after swallowing.  Very easy drinking beer especially for 7%.  Personally I like the grapefruit version better.

Pours a handsome shade of lightly hazy yellow which a finger or so of foam. Hoppy without being overwhelming the finish has a very citric character. Feels fresh and slick in the mouth without feeling watery. Perfect for the summer.

Flavors include apricot peach and possibly mango. Finish has a hint of lemon/grapefruit. Easy drinking. Not nearly as hoppy as some of New England IPA's. Wifey liked it for that reason.

Smell is floral hoppy piney grapefruit pineapple. Taste is on the sweet side but has a nice semi bitter finish. I'm picking up citrus tropical fruit hops some slight piney notes and sweet malts. Mouthfeel is light/medium with good carb. Finishes a little dry. This is one of the best IPA's I've had. I'd buy more often but Ballast Points beers here in NY are very pricey. Paid $14.99 for the six pack.

Amber gold medium carbonation 3-finger head that held on for a bit some lacing. Piney/fruity aroma with a similar taste  I get a definite pine taste with a smooth bitterness if that’s possible.

Gave it a 5 in taste because of the balance of flavors. Delicate and simply tasty beer. Big success at Xmas dinner last night. A big plus is its price to value-quality. Amazing that Ballast Point can brew this and sell at a reasonable price.

And due to its mainstream appeal you can find it almost everywhere.  The citrus and hoppy aromas are very delicate. The orange smells mixed with hoppy bitterness is just so well done. Great beer to get if the bar doesnt have other cool rotating options to try (like Buffalo Wild Wings).

The can says "dedicated to the craft" which is why they sold out to constellation. Well seriously it is still a very good IPA I just wish everybody wouldn't be selling out.  Look: semi-clear almost clear golden with an inch white head nice lacing.  Aroma: citrus tropical fruit pine resin  Taste: It is sweet fruity mango citrus and significant pine a very nice but slightly bitter flavor.  Feel: medium bodied fairly easy drinking

Poured into a pint glass. Disappointing head decent lacing. A subdued citrus smell. Pleasant bitterness. Will need to try again but this is an honest rating for what is in my glass.

Have to admit never tried it at the $14.99 six pack price that's a price above my wallet. Having said that this is a terrific beer! Special occasions only. Pours less than clear pale gold with a modest near snow white head that has superior staying power and plenty of side glass lace. Smell: Lots of pine and pine nuts along with a citrus rind hop aroma. Taste: Great balance of the pine nuts citrus hops and some up front sweet bread malts. Has great balance! Thick chewy with a slight bitter finish. The benefits of having a son-in-law that will shell out the equivalent of $60.00 for a case of beer. Rewards of having a son-in-law that can shell out beer the equivalent of $60.00 a case.

Could smell it as soon as I open the bottle and hadn't even poured it yet. The smell reminded me that hops and marijuana are closely related plants.   T: Again  grapefruit but with the earthy hop flavors predominate. Ends with a little bit of fruit at the finish like mangoes or pineapple.   F: Light but plenty of hop oils that coat your mouth.   o: Very aromatic and a solid IPA overall.  I marked it down a little because it is a little pricey for what you get so I won't be drinking it often. Definitely worth trying though.

Very good balance of malt and hops lending to an exceptional smell and taste that stays with you. Can't always get here but sometimes when you ask nice it happens. I am going to be real nice to my retailer so I can get more of this . Cheers!

The look and the smell are promising of an IPA that will be on the citrus side of things.  Then the pine cone explosion begins with the first sip.  Nowhere near as good as the Grapefruit Sculpin. 
210,/beer/profile/199/29619/,3.8,look: 3.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5,Romartin,Poured into a chilled pint glass from a bottle L. Is slightly cloudy straw with plenty of carbonation short off white head with little life little bit of lacing which doesn't hang onto the glass. S. Mild pine and citrus with with a malt foundation. T. Nice amount of pine with a bit more malt  much like the smell for me only more pronounced. F. nice carbonation retention malty pallet with a lingering sweetness. O. Enjoyable for the lighter piney IPA seeker have had it on tap which I really enjoyed why I picked up a will stay on my go to list.

So either this is a fresh can that has been exposed to extreme conditions or the labeling format is misleading and ambiguous. This beer looks nice with a clear amber appearance and with a nice two finger head that does not last for long however. The nose is fairly malty with some piney hops to provide some balance. The taste is also malty with some bitterness late on. Some caramel and toasty notes but as far as hops are concerned it's just bitterness they contribute.

Classic IPA sweet citrus and pine scent with a slight malt back. A bit less fruity than your 2017 IPA this one has a good mix of hops and malt. The feel of this beer is pretty darn good. Smooth and creamy with lingering piney bitterness on the tongue.
